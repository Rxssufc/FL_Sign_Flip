./data/Client5\sample-004000.mp3,life attracts life the alchemist answered
./data/Client5\sample-004001.mp3,many people in berkshire surrey and middlesex must have seen it
./data/Client5\sample-004002.mp3,i remember how i sat on the table there in the blackness with patches of green and crimson swimming before my eyes
./data/Client5\sample-004003.mp3,almost everyone here speaks spanish
./data/Client5\sample-004004.mp3,the walls were covered with a thick paste
./data/Client5\sample-004005.mp3,the boy was trying to understand the truth of what the old man had said
./data/Client5\sample-004006.mp3,the terror was palpable
./data/Client5\sample-004007.mp3,and yet none of these people has ever met the old king
./data/Client5\sample-004008.mp3,i didn't want to marry anybody else in town
./data/Client5\sample-004009.mp3,i bet it's a going away present
./data/Client5\sample-004010.mp3,i'll work for you he said
./data/Client5\sample-004011.mp3,there were mountains in the distance
./data/Client5\sample-004012.mp3,isn't it all too wonderful
./data/Client5\sample-004013.mp3,you can get around very easily by train  which is a very relaxing and affordable way to travel
./data/Client5\sample-004014.mp3,the miner had abandoned everything to go mining for emeralds
./data/Client5\sample-004015.mp3,i noticed that the boy answered
./data/Client5\sample-004016.mp3,she doesn't know it yet
./data/Client5\sample-004017.mp3,i remember how i sat on the table there in the blackness with patches of green and crimson swimming before my eyes
./data/Client5\sample-004018.mp3,how did you learn to read the girl asked at one point
./data/Client5\sample-004019.mp3,he noticed the unequal cooling of its surface
./data/Client5\sample-004020.mp3,the clever men could be ignored
./data/Client5\sample-004021.mp3,then he dropped his spade picked up his jacket and came out into the road
./data/Client5\sample-004022.mp3,before this i always looked to the desert with longing said fatima
./data/Client5\sample-004023.mp3,who says i can't
./data/Client5\sample-004024.mp3,i don't know how to turn them into reality
./data/Client5\sample-004025.mp3,all that time the martians must have been getting ready
./data/Client5\sample-004026.mp3,c'mon over and join our party
./data/Client5\sample-004027.mp3,so his heart was quiet for an entire afternoon
./data/Client5\sample-004028.mp3,i saw astonishment and horror on the faces of the people around me
./data/Client5\sample-004029.mp3,he told her about the morning's meeting
./data/Client5\sample-004030.mp3,my brother just got the congressional medal of honor
./data/Client5\sample-004031.mp3,if you know your heart well it will never be able to do that to you
./data/Client5\sample-004032.mp3,because you have already lost your savings twice
./data/Client5\sample-004033.mp3,this isn't for me to decide
./data/Client5\sample-004034.mp3,too bad i couldn't see this guy first
./data/Client5\sample-004035.mp3,because the crystal was dirty
./data/Client5\sample-004036.mp3,i'm an adventurer looking for treasure he said to himself
./data/Client5\sample-004037.mp3,opening the source code can be a measure to create trust in software
./data/Client5\sample-004038.mp3,its observation probabilities are computed as a product of pixel probabilities
./data/Client5\sample-004039.mp3,what he said reminded the boy of the old king
./data/Client5\sample-004040.mp3,i'm not afraid of failing
./data/Client5\sample-004041.mp3,i had a dream and i met with a king
./data/Client5\sample-004042.mp3,you left out number five
./data/Client5\sample-004043.mp3,no one seemed to have thought about it that night
./data/Client5\sample-004044.mp3,the old man opened his cape and the boy was struck by what he saw
./data/Client5\sample-004045.mp3,it may be the gases of the firing that caused the martians inconvenience
./data/Client5\sample-004046.mp3,some place to live
./data/Client5\sample-004047.mp3,last time i made the mistake of replicating a drawing by rodin
./data/Client5\sample-004048.mp3,i had the everyone has gary busey's teeth dream again
./data/Client5\sample-004049.mp3,people saw me coming and welcomed me he thought
./data/Client5\sample-004050.mp3,we don't know what's in the confounded thing do you
./data/Client5\sample-004051.mp3,it looked like a rusty gas float
./data/Client5\sample-004052.mp3,he was learning a lot of new things
./data/Client5\sample-004053.mp3,he wanted to forget about the vision and return to his meditation
./data/Client5\sample-004054.mp3,camels are traitorous they walk thousands of paces and never seem to tire
./data/Client5\sample-004055.mp3,you hit my best friend
./data/Client5\sample-004056.mp3,saul was infuriating the others
./data/Client5\sample-004057.mp3,but can we trust him
./data/Client5\sample-004058.mp3,that night there was another jetting out of gas from the distant planet
./data/Client5\sample-004059.mp3,my wife pointed out to me the brightness of the red green and yellow signal lights
./data/Client5\sample-004060.mp3,there was no way for everybody to know about alchemy
./data/Client5\sample-004061.mp3,now it will be with hope
./data/Client5\sample-004062.mp3,the first rule of don't fight club is let's talk about it
./data/Client5\sample-004063.mp3,he had found where his treasure was and was frightened at what might happen
./data/Client5\sample-004064.mp3,bakers have homes while shepherds sleep out in the open
./data/Client5\sample-004065.mp3,even though the sheep didn't teach me to speak arabic
./data/Client5\sample-004066.mp3,and he looked out over the desert that had brought him to the woman he loved
./data/Client5\sample-004067.mp3,the patriotic veteran returned to the united states
./data/Client5\sample-004068.mp3,a line of flame high can be seen in the atmosphere
./data/Client5\sample-004069.mp3,looking through the telescope i saw a circle of deep blue and the little round planet
./data/Client5\sample-004070.mp3,they whisked themselves into a frenzy
./data/Client5\sample-004071.mp3,they were relieved and happy
./data/Client5\sample-004072.mp3,i don't know why
./data/Client5\sample-004073.mp3,and for wise men gold is the metal that evolved the furthest
./data/Client5\sample-004074.mp3,tell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself
./data/Client5\sample-004075.mp3,why did you want to see me the boy asked
./data/Client5\sample-004076.mp3,i wonder how many times a year this happens
./data/Client5\sample-004077.mp3,most meteorites are more or less rounded
./data/Client5\sample-004078.mp3,the boy preferred wine
./data/Client5\sample-004079.mp3,henderson stood up with a spade in his hand
./data/Client5\sample-004080.mp3,how much is your equity in it
./data/Client5\sample-004081.mp3,the two men exchanged some words in arabic and the bar owner seemed irritated
./data/Client5\sample-004082.mp3,he was twenty minutes from his tent and began to make his way there
./data/Client5\sample-004083.mp3,not always in this way but i always appear in one form or another
./data/Client5\sample-004084.mp3,put jackie right on the staff
./data/Client5\sample-004085.mp3,you can't believe it's not butter
./data/Client5\sample-004086.mp3,he was immensely excited at the news
./data/Client5\sample-004087.mp3,i don't know anything
./data/Client5\sample-004088.mp3,that's never happened to me the boy said
./data/Client5\sample-004089.mp3,three taps is me
./data/Client5\sample-004090.mp3,bakers have homes while shepherds sleep out in the open
./data/Client5\sample-004091.mp3,absolutely despicable that gingerbread men are forced to live in houses made of their own flesh
./data/Client5\sample-004092.mp3,now you just turn this way and go right straight down
./data/Client5\sample-004093.mp3,at most they thought that another meteorite had descended
./data/Client5\sample-004094.mp3,but his heart was speaking of other things
./data/Client5\sample-004095.mp3,maybe tomorrow said the boy moving away
./data/Client5\sample-004096.mp3,i've got to see nicole right away
./data/Client5\sample-004097.mp3,why do they make things so complicated he asked the englishman one night
./data/Client5\sample-004098.mp3,henderson went into the railway station to telegraph the news to london
./data/Client5\sample-004099.mp3,they're just a pile of stones
./data/Client5\sample-004100.mp3,my friend said i love you
./data/Client5\sample-004101.mp3,so he began to wander through the city and found himself at the gates
./data/Client5\sample-004102.mp3,second with a keyboard you can hold a movement key and release when you reach your location
./data/Client5\sample-004103.mp3,did you tell them that funny story you told me yesterday
./data/Client5\sample-004104.mp3,you should see the other guy specifically how good at fighting he is
./data/Client5\sample-004105.mp3,the boy began to dig into the dune
./data/Client5\sample-004106.mp3,he wasn't as good as i was expecting
./data/Client5\sample-004107.mp3,as soon as he saw me among the crowd he called to me to come down
./data/Client5\sample-004108.mp3,he tried again to concentrate on the pink shades of the desert and its stones
./data/Client5\sample-004109.mp3,children jumping in puddles
./data/Client5\sample-004110.mp3,i locked eyes with a fish in the tank
./data/Client5\sample-004111.mp3,something happens here you'll have to remember later on
./data/Client5\sample-004112.mp3,and this is for me said the alchemist keeping one of the parts
./data/Client5\sample-004113.mp3,i went stretching my legs clumsily and feeling my way in the dark
./data/Client5\sample-004114.mp3,we ate spicy rice with chicken legs and white mushrooms
./data/Client5\sample-004115.mp3,the crowd swayed a little as i elbowed my way through
./data/Client5\sample-004116.mp3,i think we can do better after the boat sails
./data/Client5\sample-004117.mp3,many of our soldiers teamed up
./data/Client5\sample-004118.mp3,much better said the old man
./data/Client5\sample-004119.mp3,i was just in town earlier this year so it is kind of crazy to think about what took place right after
./data/Client5\sample-004120.mp3,in alchemy it's called the soul of the world
./data/Client5\sample-004121.mp3,one afternoon they passed by the encampment of one of the tribes
./data/Client5\sample-004122.mp3,he was learning a lot of new things
./data/Client5\sample-004123.mp3,it seemed such a little thing so bright and small and still
./data/Client5\sample-004124.mp3,but the boy never took his eye off his new friend
./data/Client5\sample-004125.mp3,the boy didn't know what to say
./data/Client5\sample-004126.mp3,you wanna take this outside
./data/Client5\sample-004127.mp3,do you know what cia stands for
./data/Client5\sample-004128.mp3,i don't know what she's talking about
./data/Client5\sample-004129.mp3,henderson went into the railway station to telegraph the news to london
./data/Client5\sample-004130.mp3,but if you have to go before then go on in pursuit of your dream
./data/Client5\sample-004131.mp3,be less complicated without a family
./data/Client5\sample-004132.mp3,the lumberjack jumped up the tree
./data/Client5\sample-004133.mp3,do you know what i mean
./data/Client5\sample-004134.mp3,he almost began to tell about his treasure but decided not to do so
./data/Client5\sample-004135.mp3,i should say not
./data/Client5\sample-004136.mp3,no doubt the impact had caused a flash of fire
./data/Client5\sample-004137.mp3,but finally he agreed that the boy who spoke better arabic than he should do so
./data/Client5\sample-004138.mp3,looking up he saw a pair of hawks flying high in the sky
./data/Client5\sample-004139.mp3,i'm the stranger around here
./data/Client5\sample-004140.mp3,but he had to move on
./data/Client5\sample-004141.mp3,the englishman could not contain his excitement
./data/Client5\sample-004142.mp3,it seemed such a little thing so bright and small and still
./data/Client5\sample-004143.mp3,storm increasing over the rockies
./data/Client5\sample-004144.mp3,he was selling better than ever
./data/Client5\sample-004145.mp3,they ate in silence
./data/Client5\sample-004146.mp3,i want to stay at the oasis the boy answered
./data/Client5\sample-004147.mp3,so it's better to listen to what it has to say
./data/Client5\sample-004148.mp3,strange images passed through my mind
./data/Client5\sample-004149.mp3,the boy didn't know what to say
./data/Client5\sample-004150.mp3,i thought the unscrewing might be automatic
./data/Client5\sample-004151.mp3,she improved her list every day
./data/Client5\sample-004152.mp3,it seemed so safe and tranquil
./data/Client5\sample-004153.mp3,but he found it much more interesting to observe the caravan and listen to the wind
./data/Client5\sample-004154.mp3,it's called the principle of favorability beginner's luck
./data/Client5\sample-004155.mp3,when he had completed the cleaning he asked the man for something to eat
./data/Client5\sample-004156.mp3,the whole army of them
./data/Client5\sample-004157.mp3,it's the only name i've got
./data/Client5\sample-004158.mp3,it means only that the heart does what it can the alchemist said
./data/Client5\sample-004159.mp3,at that point the omens will tell you that your treasure is buried forever
./data/Client5\sample-004160.mp3,younger man what he had seen and the man asked him to wait there
./data/Client5\sample-004161.mp3,the guy thought he was a lunatic at large and made an unsuccessful attempt to stop him
./data/Client5\sample-004162.mp3,the closer he got to the realization of his dream the more difficult things became
./data/Client5\sample-004163.mp3,henderson was taking it in
./data/Client5\sample-004164.mp3,she's good enough for me
./data/Client5\sample-004165.mp3,in some places the ground was covered with the salt of driedup lakes
./data/Client5\sample-004166.mp3,get me walter burns
./data/Client5\sample-004167.mp3,i was disappointed at this inanimate bulk
./data/Client5\sample-004168.mp3,he was learning a lot of new things
./data/Client5\sample-004169.mp3,there were raised voicesand some sort of struggle appeared to be going on 
./data/Client5\sample-004170.mp3,i think i sprained my pride
./data/Client5\sample-004171.mp3,you want the moon
./data/Client5\sample-004172.mp3,don't say anything fatima interrupted
./data/Client5\sample-004173.mp3,henderson went into the railway station to telegraph the news to london
./data/Client5\sample-004174.mp3,i said i wish i'd never been born
./data/Client5\sample-004175.mp3,at that time it was quite clear in my own mind that the thing had come from the planet mars
./data/Client5\sample-004176.mp3,he stood irresolute for a moment and then scrambled out of the pit
./data/Client5\sample-004177.mp3,because you will never again be able to keep it quiet
./data/Client5\sample-004178.mp3,what was all that
./data/Client5\sample-004179.mp3,and also because i know about the soul of the world he thought to himself
./data/Client5\sample-004180.mp3,how much is your equity in it
./data/Client5\sample-004181.mp3,there was a murmur from the crowd
./data/Client5\sample-004182.mp3,he quickly pulled his hands away
./data/Client5\sample-004183.mp3,the camel driver understood what the boy was saying
./data/Client5\sample-004184.mp3,love required them to stay with the people they loved
./data/Client5\sample-004185.mp3,enough said the boy
./data/Client5\sample-004186.mp3,i am following my destiny
./data/Client5\sample-004187.mp3,but the englishman was exultant
./data/Client5\sample-004188.mp3,then suppose you give me the money
./data/Client5\sample-004189.mp3,the merchants were assembling their stalls and the boy helped a candy seller to do his
./data/Client5\sample-004190.mp3,but they were not there
./data/Client5\sample-004191.mp3,elizabeth reclined gracefully
./data/Client5\sample-004192.mp3,this jelly doesn't taste of limes
./data/Client5\sample-004193.mp3,and the alchemist understood that the boy's heart had returned to the soul of the world
./data/Client5\sample-004194.mp3,people said that gypsies spent their lives tricking others
./data/Client5\sample-004195.mp3,she refilled her vessel and left
./data/Client5\sample-004196.mp3,the loafers and golf caddies were used to hanging out near the railway station
./data/Client5\sample-004197.mp3,he could sell the stones and buy a return ticket
./data/Client5\sample-004198.mp3,but the alchemist continued to look to the horizon
./data/Client5\sample-004199.mp3,fastfood is convenient but often unhealthy
./data/Client5\sample-004200.mp3,he had already seen many people come and go and the desert remained as it was
./data/Client5\sample-004201.mp3,i know why i want to get back to my flock he thought
./data/Client5\sample-004202.mp3,the toilet needed cleaning
./data/Client5\sample-004203.mp3,so how will we name all these hurricanes
./data/Client5\sample-004204.mp3,my seven year resume gap is marked not drugs
./data/Client5\sample-004205.mp3,the land was ruined and i had to find some other way to earn a living
./data/Client5\sample-004206.mp3,the thing itself was almost entirely buried in sand
./data/Client5\sample-004207.mp3,worked hard just to have food and water like the sheep
./data/Client5\sample-004208.mp3,why did we have to have all these kids
./data/Client5\sample-004209.mp3,i'm going to them
./data/Client5\sample-004210.mp3,as i watched the planet seemed to grow larger and smaller
./data/Client5\sample-004211.mp3,you should see the other guy specifically how good at fighting he is
./data/Client5\sample-004212.mp3,an old man with a breastplate of gold wouldn't have lied just to acquire six sheep
./data/Client5\sample-004213.mp3,the boy became fearful the omens told him that something was wrong
./data/Client5\sample-004214.mp3,he had done this for years and knew the schedule of everyone who passed
./data/Client5\sample-004215.mp3,the englishman vanished too gone to find the alchemist
./data/Client5\sample-004216.mp3,just a memory right now it signified shade water and a refuge from the war
./data/Client5\sample-004217.mp3,it drew a droplet of blood
./data/Client5\sample-004218.mp3,so what should i do now the boy asked
./data/Client5\sample-004219.mp3,the hand that evokes love and creates a twin soul for every person in the world
./data/Client5\sample-004220.mp3,aldo and his grandma quickly discovered a new passion for coding
./data/Client5\sample-004221.mp3,he was alarmed by what had happened
./data/Client5\sample-004222.mp3,i hope he grows up to look like you
./data/Client5\sample-004223.mp3,that was his work
./data/Client5\sample-004224.mp3,well why don't we go there right now the boy asked
./data/Client5\sample-004225.mp3,i'm hunting with my falcon the alchemist answered
./data/Client5\sample-004226.mp3,she ought to be here any minute
./data/Client5\sample-004227.mp3,that makes sense the alchemist answered
./data/Client5\sample-004228.mp3,i saw the shopkeeper struggling near the edge of the pit
./data/Client5\sample-004229.mp3,they mounted their horses
./data/Client5\sample-004230.mp3,nearby was the englishman reading a book
./data/Client5\sample-004231.mp3,i didn't need to waste my time just for this he said
./data/Client5\sample-004232.mp3,then what's a big political boss like shiela daniels doing in town
./data/Client5\sample-004233.mp3,she was reminded of her mistakes
./data/Client5\sample-004234.mp3,who is this stranger who speaks of omens asked one of the chieftains eyeing the boy
./data/Client5\sample-004235.mp3,the nearby city of ceuta had grown faster than tangier and business had fallen off
./data/Client5\sample-004236.mp3,the concrete was covered in moss
./data/Client5\sample-004237.mp3,only one third of the rubbish is being recycled in this country
./data/Client5\sample-004238.mp3,for a moment everything was dark and scary
./data/Client5\sample-004239.mp3,i heard a faint movement under my feet
./data/Client5\sample-004240.mp3,there were lights in the upper windows of the houses when the people went to bed
./data/Client5\sample-004241.mp3,will i learn to do that someday the boy asked
./data/Client5\sample-004242.mp3,something inside the cylinder was unscrewing the top
./data/Client5\sample-004243.mp3,the time must have been somewhere around six o'clock
./data/Client5\sample-004244.mp3,if you're looking for a room there's no vacancy
./data/Client5\sample-004245.mp3,but it is not a class that was requested by our alumni or prospective students
./data/Client5\sample-004246.mp3,the end of the cylinder was still as ogilvy and henderson had left it
./data/Client5\sample-004247.mp3,what time is it
./data/Client5\sample-004248.mp3,i could have helped her
./data/Client5\sample-004249.mp3,i just want to dream about mecca
./data/Client5\sample-004250.mp3,this is for the boy
./data/Client5\sample-004251.mp3,absolutely despicable that gingerbread men are forced to live in houses made of their own flesh
./data/Client5\sample-004252.mp3,it was such a gradual movement that he found it only by noticing the dots
./data/Client5\sample-004253.mp3,some of those who saw its flight say it travelled with a hissing sound
./data/Client5\sample-004254.mp3,good luck to you
./data/Client5\sample-004255.mp3,criminals cry for it
./data/Client5\sample-004256.mp3,even though the sheep didn't teach me to speak arabic
./data/Client5\sample-004257.mp3,i felt like being in paradise
./data/Client5\sample-004258.mp3,now what's the story
./data/Client5\sample-004259.mp3,you point to a trail of ants leading into the house
./data/Client5\sample-004260.mp3,i think they perceived that nothing was to be done at the moment
./data/Client5\sample-004261.mp3,he was betting on that outcome
./data/Client5\sample-004262.mp3,he had tried in vain to establish a relationship with an alchemist
./data/Client5\sample-004263.mp3,i'd like to take a bath
./data/Client5\sample-004264.mp3,i know you'll pay it back when you can
./data/Client5\sample-004265.mp3,he transformed himself into a stone that rolled up to the miner's foot
./data/Client5\sample-004266.mp3,i'd know that voice anywhere
./data/Client5\sample-004267.mp3,you'll take fifty and like it
./data/Client5\sample-004268.mp3,the first day passed
./data/Client5\sample-004269.mp3,i've been trying to figure it out
./data/Client5\sample-004270.mp3,as they moved along the boy tried to listen to his heart
./data/Client5\sample-004271.mp3,canada is quite cold at times
./data/Client5\sample-004272.mp3,acne is mainly a problem for teenagers
./data/Client5\sample-004273.mp3,don't let facebook take up all of your time
./data/Client5\sample-004274.mp3,i usually like to eat flying tomato salad
./data/Client5\sample-004275.mp3,why the shots stopped after the tenth no one on earth has tried to explain
./data/Client5\sample-004276.mp3,i thought the unscrewing might be automatic
./data/Client5\sample-004277.mp3,and so will you
./data/Client5\sample-004278.mp3,and because the tribes declared war i went to the well seeking the alchemist
./data/Client5\sample-004279.mp3,i told you baldwin was in trouble
./data/Client5\sample-004280.mp3,they eat lunch together often but dont really talk outside the office
./data/Client5\sample-004281.mp3,they were inspired by that disaster to never let it happen again
./data/Client5\sample-004282.mp3,give me my book the boy said
./data/Client5\sample-004283.mp3,the alchemist removed the pan from the fire and set it aside to cool
./data/Client5\sample-004284.mp3,and you married her
./data/Client5\sample-004285.mp3,the one in there
./data/Client5\sample-004286.mp3,and she already has her treasure it's you
./data/Client5\sample-004287.mp3,we always observe the tradition
./data/Client5\sample-004288.mp3,how do you feel
./data/Client5\sample-004289.mp3,the two were taken to a nearby military camp
./data/Client5\sample-004290.mp3,they're always after me for interviews
./data/Client5\sample-004291.mp3,its been a long time since she last read chekhov and because of that she no longer feels like the heroine of her own story
./data/Client5\sample-004292.mp3,who's down there with you
./data/Client5\sample-004293.mp3,have you got my dough
./data/Client5\sample-004294.mp3,just like an organ
./data/Client5\sample-004295.mp3,an huge hole had been made by the impact of the projectile
./data/Client5\sample-004296.mp3,they formed heaps that are visible a mile and a half away
./data/Client5\sample-004297.mp3,and that's where the power of love comes in
./data/Client5\sample-004298.mp3,except for my ulcers
./data/Client5\sample-004299.mp3,you ought to stay over
./data/Client5\sample-004300.mp3,i told him that was what i had come here to learn
./data/Client5\sample-004301.mp3,the wind's curiosity was aroused something that had never happened before
./data/Client5\sample-004302.mp3,they're starting to throw things
./data/Client5\sample-004303.mp3,you dont compare directly to existing stateoftheart methods
./data/Client5\sample-004304.mp3,my mind ran on the possibilities of its content
./data/Client5\sample-004305.mp3,the elevators are still running
./data/Client5\sample-004306.mp3,a large portion of the cylinder had been uncovered
./data/Client5\sample-004307.mp3,he had not a cent in his pocket but he had faith
./data/Client5\sample-004308.mp3,all they ever do really is look for food and water
./data/Client5\sample-004309.mp3,the angel touched the man's shoulder and they were both projected far into the future
./data/Client5\sample-004310.mp3,two days later the merchant spoke to the boy about the display
./data/Client5\sample-004311.mp3,the desert was all sand in some stretches and rocky in others
./data/Client5\sample-004312.mp3,that doesn't say much for mine
./data/Client5\sample-004313.mp3,i used to pitch
./data/Client5\sample-004314.mp3,see that miss baker gets a car to take her home
./data/Client5\sample-004315.mp3,the boy's heart began to speak of fear
./data/Client5\sample-004316.mp3,the cushion was soft and inviting
./data/Client5\sample-004317.mp3,i heard a peculiar humming sound from the pit
./data/Client5\sample-004318.mp3,they set off running wildly into the trees
./data/Client5\sample-004319.mp3,but everything had changed
./data/Client5\sample-004320.mp3,sometimes there's just no way to hold back the river
./data/Client5\sample-004321.mp3,how do you feel
./data/Client5\sample-004322.mp3,there were really i think two or three hundred people elbowing one another
./data/Client5\sample-004323.mp3,stand by to contact amanda
./data/Client5\sample-004324.mp3,air was either entering or escaping at the rim with a thin sizzling sound
./data/Client5\sample-004325.mp3,it's going to take a while the boy said
./data/Client5\sample-004326.mp3,when he saw henderson in his garden he called over the fence and made himself understood
./data/Client5\sample-004327.mp3,i've got to talk to you straight from the shoulder
./data/Client5\sample-004328.mp3,stop treating me like a child
./data/Client5\sample-004329.mp3,i found a little crowd of about twenty people surrounding the huge hole
./data/Client5\sample-004330.mp3,maybe she didn't even remember him
./data/Client5\sample-004331.mp3,i'm a desert woman and i'm proud of that
./data/Client5\sample-004332.mp3,not what you'd call rich
./data/Client5\sample-004333.mp3,it's not a battle of good against evil
./data/Client5\sample-004334.mp3,but here's the funniest part of it all
./data/Client5\sample-004335.mp3,that's the first time you've been right today
./data/Client5\sample-004336.mp3,then i suggest you call one of them
./data/Client5\sample-004337.mp3,my sisters arent telling me everything i need to know to get there
./data/Client5\sample-004338.mp3,he was about the same age and height as the boy
./data/Client5\sample-004339.mp3,what makes you think they're even interested
./data/Client5\sample-004340.mp3,that's a good luck omen the englishman said after the fat arab had gone out
./data/Client5\sample-004341.mp3,the biggest living thing is a mushroom
./data/Client5\sample-004342.mp3,i'm going to hate those who have found their treasure because i never found mine
./data/Client5\sample-004343.mp3,they don't believe us
./data/Client5\sample-004344.mp3,the boy smiled to himself
./data/Client5\sample-004345.mp3,this is for the boy
./data/Client5\sample-004346.mp3,the young arab took out a book and began to read
./data/Client5\sample-004347.mp3,he was about the same age and height as the boy
./data/Client5\sample-004348.mp3,so we their hearts speak more and more softly
./data/Client5\sample-004349.mp3,a fine bunch of reporters
./data/Client5\sample-004350.mp3,then suddenly he noticed it with a start
./data/Client5\sample-004351.mp3,ask the owner of that stall how much the sword costs he said to his friend
./data/Client5\sample-004352.mp3,but the marketplace was empty and he was far from home so he wept
./data/Client5\sample-004353.mp3,i've been trying to figure it out
./data/Client5\sample-004354.mp3,and he vanished around the corner of the plaza
./data/Client5\sample-004355.mp3,at that point in their lives everything is clear and everything is possible
./data/Client5\sample-004356.mp3,but bakers are more important people than shepherds
./data/Client5\sample-004357.mp3,the boy had met the alchemist
./data/Client5\sample-004358.mp3,but there were certain of them who took a bit longer to awaken
./data/Client5\sample-004359.mp3,i got drunk yesterday and thought i built a super computer
./data/Client5\sample-004360.mp3,he moved about invisible but everyone could hear him
./data/Client5\sample-004361.mp3,can i go now
./data/Client5\sample-004362.mp3,how are you
./data/Client5\sample-004363.mp3,all i saw was an army said the boy
./data/Client5\sample-004364.mp3,what do you need
./data/Client5\sample-004365.mp3,this morning i found a calculator taped to my wii
./data/Client5\sample-004366.mp3,but they really don't know what they're saying
./data/Client5\sample-004367.mp3,the mixture took on a reddish color almost the color of blood
./data/Client5\sample-004368.mp3,a large portion of the cylinder had been uncovered
./data/Client5\sample-004369.mp3,everyone has his or her own way of learning things he said to himself
./data/Client5\sample-004370.mp3,i just don't trust anyone who says they've never had hamburger helper
./data/Client5\sample-004371.mp3,but it is not a class that was requested by our alumni or prospective students
./data/Client5\sample-004372.mp3,at that time it was quite clear in my own mind that the thing had come from the planet mars
./data/Client5\sample-004373.mp3,but i didnt think that it contained any living creature
./data/Client5\sample-004374.mp3,he took back his books and packed them away again in their bags
./data/Client5\sample-004375.mp3,you'll wreck your raincoat
./data/Client5\sample-004376.mp3,i'm doing much better and soon you'll be able to return to your sheep
./data/Client5\sample-004377.mp3,but most important he was able every day to live out his dream
./data/Client5\sample-004378.mp3,the achieved results are far behind the stateoftheart in image classification
./data/Client5\sample-004379.mp3,it seemed to him that it fell to earth about one hundred miles east of here
./data/Client5\sample-004380.mp3,maybe they're like me
./data/Client5\sample-004381.mp3,it's no miracle because i see it happen once every year
./data/Client5\sample-004382.mp3,he moved about invisible but everyone could hear him
./data/Client5\sample-004383.mp3,i just know that the tradition is always right
./data/Client5\sample-004384.mp3,now it will be with hope
./data/Client5\sample-004385.mp3,but i found it difficult to get to work because of the investigations
./data/Client5\sample-004386.mp3,it was impossible to remember all the details that he covered in an hour
./data/Client5\sample-004387.mp3,and he asked the boy if he too were in search of the alchemist
./data/Client5\sample-004388.mp3,when i returned to the common the sun was setting
./data/Client5\sample-004389.mp3,but finally the merchant appeared and asked the boy to shear four sheep
./data/Client5\sample-004390.mp3,it's a sacrifice we all ought to be glad to make
./data/Client5\sample-004391.mp3,education is very important
./data/Client5\sample-004392.mp3,i didn't know whose it was
./data/Client5\sample-004393.mp3,i didn't come here to have you read my palm he said already regretting having come
./data/Client5\sample-004394.mp3,they were both silent for a time observing the plaza and the townspeople
./data/Client5\sample-004395.mp3,and one or two persons were returning
./data/Client5\sample-004396.mp3,i think they perceived that nothing was to be done at the moment
./data/Client5\sample-004397.mp3,and i will tell you how to find the hidden treasure
./data/Client5\sample-004398.mp3,his heart was heavy and he had been melancholy since the previous night
./data/Client5\sample-004399.mp3,and yet none of these people has ever met the old king
./data/Client5\sample-004400.mp3,artisanal gin bar seriously
./data/Client5\sample-004401.mp3,i went stretching my legs clumsily and feeling my way in the dark
./data/Client5\sample-004402.mp3,the sun thought about that and decided to shine more brightly
./data/Client5\sample-004403.mp3,that's what she did to me
./data/Client5\sample-004404.mp3,well then why do we need all these books the boy asked
./data/Client5\sample-004405.mp3,few people realise the immensity of vacancy
./data/Client5\sample-004406.mp3,bob lifted the dusty scroll
./data/Client5\sample-004407.mp3,the authors claim to specifically address variations due to geometric transformations in the acquired images
./data/Client5\sample-004408.mp3,pull this lever to activate the piston
./data/Client5\sample-004409.mp3,we're just travelers the alchemist answered
./data/Client5\sample-004410.mp3,i wouldn't be a bit surprised
./data/Client5\sample-004411.mp3,we're refugees from the tribal wars and we need money the other figure said
./data/Client5\sample-004412.mp3,and your camels will bring you wealth and power
./data/Client5\sample-004413.mp3,in spite of this i still believed that there were men in mars
./data/Client5\sample-004414.mp3,what's that got to do with it
./data/Client5\sample-004415.mp3,you're not going anywhere
./data/Client5\sample-004416.mp3,vibrations of peace throughout the tent
./data/Client5\sample-004417.mp3,from that day on the oasis would be an empty place for her
./data/Client5\sample-004418.mp3,i finally have enough money and all the time i need
./data/Client5\sample-004419.mp3,she would never know the difference because she didn't know how to read
./data/Client5\sample-004420.mp3,never mind the money
./data/Client5\sample-004421.mp3,i want to see the chieftains
./data/Client5\sample-004422.mp3,i need to sell some wool the boy told the merchant
./data/Client5\sample-004423.mp3,i thought the unscrewing might be automatic
./data/Client5\sample-004424.mp3,they had gone away to breakfast at henderson's house
./data/Client5\sample-004425.mp3,that night there was another jetting out of gas from the distant planet
./data/Client5\sample-004426.mp3,show me where there is life out in the desert
./data/Client5\sample-004427.mp3,did she discuss it with you
./data/Client5\sample-004428.mp3,there were three hundred wells fifty thousand date trees and innumerable colored tents spread among them
./data/Client5\sample-004429.mp3,the night was warm and i was thirsty
./data/Client5\sample-004430.mp3,some people make the same mistakes over and over again
./data/Client5\sample-004431.mp3,the genies were the spirits of good and evil
./data/Client5\sample-004432.mp3,for at that time it had not occurred to him that it might be hollow
./data/Client5\sample-004433.mp3,you should show that your method improves results
./data/Client5\sample-004434.mp3,but the boy knew that he was referring to fatima
./data/Client5\sample-004435.mp3,the day was dawning and the shepherd urged his sheep in the direction of the sun
./data/Client5\sample-004436.mp3,the boy was trying to understand the truth of what the old man had said
./data/Client5\sample-004437.mp3,melchizedek watched a small ship that was plowing its way out of the port
./data/Client5\sample-004438.mp3,meanwhile the old man persisted in his attempt to strike up a conversation
./data/Client5\sample-004439.mp3,go back to watching the caravan he said
./data/Client5\sample-004440.mp3,at the highest point in tarifa there is an old fort built by the moors
./data/Client5\sample-004441.mp3,the stranger placed his sword in its scabbard and the boy relaxed
./data/Client5\sample-004442.mp3,you wanna take this outside
./data/Client5\sample-004443.mp3,the men climbed the hill and they were tired when they reached the top
./data/Client5\sample-004444.mp3,she says it's nothing to worry about
./data/Client5\sample-004445.mp3,they looked for the fallen mass but found nothing
./data/Client5\sample-004446.mp3,the old man was probably a gypsy too
./data/Client5\sample-004447.mp3,give me that call on patrick's wire
./data/Client5\sample-004448.mp3,before this i always looked to the desert with longing said fatima
./data/Client5\sample-004449.mp3,they walked together through the narrow streets of tangier
./data/Client5\sample-004450.mp3,i have to separate out the sulfur
./data/Client5\sample-004451.mp3,so he could not be hasty nor impatient
./data/Client5\sample-004452.mp3,no one can be from many places the boy said
./data/Client5\sample-004453.mp3,we'll have to satisfy them
./data/Client5\sample-004454.mp3,the alchemist followed as the boy's horse ran for almost half an hour
./data/Client5\sample-004455.mp3,henderson stood up with a spade in his hand
./data/Client5\sample-004456.mp3,but then i realized she couldn't have been
./data/Client5\sample-004457.mp3,of course the two were unable to do anything
./data/Client5\sample-004458.mp3,even then he hardly understood what this meant
./data/Client5\sample-004459.mp3,they were his treasure
./data/Client5\sample-004460.mp3,the boy was relieved
./data/Client5\sample-004461.mp3,he must be disguised to avoid encounters with thieves
./data/Client5\sample-004462.mp3,it brought his heart into his mouth
./data/Client5\sample-004463.mp3,one needs all one's time and energy for a career
./data/Client5\sample-004464.mp3,the boy swore that every time he heard the alarm he would heed its message
./data/Client5\sample-004465.mp3,the boy repeated his question
./data/Client5\sample-004466.mp3,today i understand something i didn't see before every blessing ignored becomes a curse
./data/Client5\sample-004467.mp3,if a person is living out his destiny he knows everything he needs to know
./data/Client5\sample-004468.mp3,do you mind if we go someplace crowded
./data/Client5\sample-004469.mp3,there were lights in the upper windows of the houses when the people went to bed
./data/Client5\sample-004470.mp3,there was a small building there with a window at which people bought tickets to africa
./data/Client5\sample-004471.mp3,a thin circle of bright metal showed between the top and the body of the cylinder
./data/Client5\sample-004472.mp3,the trouble with you is you let people step on you
./data/Client5\sample-004473.mp3,that's a good luck omen the englishman said after the fat arab had gone out
./data/Client5\sample-004474.mp3,at once he connected the two incidents
./data/Client5\sample-004475.mp3,it was seen early in the morning rushing over eastward
./data/Client5\sample-004476.mp3,do you like cooking
./data/Client5\sample-004477.mp3,work in progress
./data/Client5\sample-004478.mp3,i'd like to live in it
./data/Client5\sample-004479.mp3,the silicon sealant has dried
./data/Client5\sample-004480.mp3,this wedge prevents the trailer from rolling down the slope in case of brake failure
./data/Client5\sample-004481.mp3,i was disappointed at this inanimate bulk
./data/Client5\sample-004482.mp3,the sheep had taught him that
./data/Client5\sample-004483.mp3,in his heart he wanted to remain awake but he also wanted to sleep
./data/Client5\sample-004484.mp3,they become the soul o f the world
./data/Client5\sample-004485.mp3,it's a code said the boy a bit disappointed
./data/Client5\sample-004486.mp3,the desert with its endless monotony put him to dreaming
./data/Client5\sample-004487.mp3,what do you want here today the desert asked him
./data/Client5\sample-004488.mp3,because now he knew where his treasure was
./data/Client5\sample-004489.mp3,and so despite the fact that he was a roman centurion he converted to their faith
./data/Client5\sample-004490.mp3,but there was a sixth day the sun went on
./data/Client5\sample-004491.mp3,it's true life really is generous to those who pursue their destiny the boy thought
./data/Client5\sample-004492.mp3,it had a diameter of about thirty yards
./data/Client5\sample-004493.mp3,and my name's michael
./data/Client5\sample-004494.mp3,about three years ago i set up dragon naturally speaking on my home computer
./data/Client5\sample-004495.mp3,he had seen the shooting star and was persuaded that a meteorite lay somewhere nearby
./data/Client5\sample-004496.mp3,it had a diameter of about thirty yards
./data/Client5\sample-004497.mp3,suppose there was a shane york and he walked into this office
./data/Client5\sample-004498.mp3,he approached the mass and was surprised at the size and the shape
./data/Client5\sample-004499.mp3,you telephoned me to meet you
./data/Client5\sample-004500.mp3,yours sincerely satan
./data/Client5\sample-004501.mp3,on the following day the first clear sign of danger appeared
./data/Client5\sample-004502.mp3,but then he remembered that he wasn't going to have to pay anything
./data/Client5\sample-004503.mp3,somebody threw him off a train
./data/Client5\sample-004504.mp3,they're recognizing great britain
./data/Client5\sample-004505.mp3,i'm looking for a treasure said the boy and he immediately regretted having said it
./data/Client5\sample-004506.mp3,you don't have to be rich skinny popular or even own a cape to perform a random act of kindness
./data/Client5\sample-004507.mp3,in order to find the treasure you will have to follow the omens
./data/Client5\sample-004508.mp3,you can't offer me something that is already mine the chief said arrogantly
./data/Client5\sample-004509.mp3,sometimes it's better to be with the sheep who don't say anything
./data/Client5\sample-004510.mp3,there was very little talking
./data/Client5\sample-004511.mp3,history teaches us that humans do not learn from history
./data/Client5\sample-004512.mp3,after all who doesnt want to overcome new challenges and achieve great heights
./data/Client5\sample-004513.mp3,of course it's the place
./data/Client5\sample-004514.mp3,i didn't need to waste my time just for this he said
./data/Client5\sample-004515.mp3,the alchemist lighted the fire and soon a delicious aroma filled the tent
./data/Client5\sample-004516.mp3,he approached the mass and was surprised at the size and the shape
./data/Client5\sample-004517.mp3,the crow tilted its head as if it was thinking
./data/Client5\sample-004518.mp3,it would have been visible to me had i only looked up as it passed
./data/Client5\sample-004519.mp3,if it were he would already have heard of it
./data/Client5\sample-004520.mp3,it would have been visible to me had i only looked up as it passed
./data/Client5\sample-004521.mp3,my seven year resume gap is marked not drugs
./data/Client5\sample-004522.mp3,but he had to move on
./data/Client5\sample-004523.mp3,the boy continued to listen to his heart as they crossed the desert
./data/Client5\sample-004524.mp3,will you put that thing away
./data/Client5\sample-004525.mp3,his heart was heavy and he had been melancholy since the previous night
./data/Client5\sample-004526.mp3,they were surrounded by children curious to look at the animals and people that were arriving
./data/Client5\sample-004527.mp3,since the miner had sacrificed everything to his destiny the old man decided to become involved
./data/Client5\sample-004528.mp3,maybe this is an omen said the englishman half aloud
./data/Client5\sample-004529.mp3,but i didnt think that it contained any living creature
./data/Client5\sample-004530.mp3,with the girl with the raven hair his days would never be the same again
./data/Client5\sample-004531.mp3,but horses tire bit by bit
./data/Client5\sample-004532.mp3,but he certainly didn't desire that an army invade the oasis
./data/Client5\sample-004533.mp3,first you need to install an extension that labels clickable elements on the page
./data/Client5\sample-004534.mp3,can you imagine that
./data/Client5\sample-004535.mp3,'m all about those invisible cosmic connections that transcend time and distance
./data/Client5\sample-004536.mp3,i'll just go upstairs and send it over with a messenger
./data/Client5\sample-004537.mp3,it was the levanter the wind that came from africa
./data/Client5\sample-004538.mp3,men have never understood the words of the wise
./data/Client5\sample-004539.mp3,i said with the mouth shut
./data/Client5\sample-004540.mp3,even when all you want to do is travel
./data/Client5\sample-004541.mp3,a thin circle of bright metal showed between the top and the body of the cylinder
./data/Client5\sample-004542.mp3,continue in the direction of the pyramids said the alchemist
./data/Client5\sample-004543.mp3,you can also try open source clients but make sure to choose one that supports rootless mode
./data/Client5\sample-004544.mp3,it was no more exciting than an overturned carriage or a tree blown across the road
./data/Client5\sample-004545.mp3,only when he consents
./data/Client5\sample-004546.mp3,i don't blame them
./data/Client5\sample-004547.mp3,we want to see you
./data/Client5\sample-004548.mp3,tomorrow sell your camel and buy a horse
./data/Client5\sample-004549.mp3,about eleven i walked back to my home in maybury because nothing seemed to be happening
./data/Client5\sample-004550.mp3,it could prove fatal for them as well as yourself
./data/Client5\sample-004551.mp3,he was twenty minutes from his tent and began to make his way there
./data/Client5\sample-004552.mp3,please don't be lazy
./data/Client5\sample-004553.mp3,laura took out a cigarette and placed it in her mouth
./data/Client5\sample-004554.mp3,it was due to her knowledge and experience that she solved the mystery first
./data/Client5\sample-004555.mp3,maybe tomorrow will be better than yesterday
./data/Client5\sample-004556.mp3,the boy smiled and continued digging
./data/Client5\sample-004557.mp3,christine valued her freedom and would never deny anyone that privilege
./data/Client5\sample-004558.mp3,like eating or sleeping or like seeking love or finding a job
./data/Client5\sample-004559.mp3,well it's a long list
./data/Client5\sample-004560.mp3,the old man gave a signal and everyone stood
./data/Client5\sample-004561.mp3,how did you learn to read the girl asked at one point
./data/Client5\sample-004562.mp3,i wish you every possible happiness and joy
./data/Client5\sample-004563.mp3,so that those who have the responsibility for understanding can understand he said
./data/Client5\sample-004564.mp3,just by looking at them
./data/Client5\sample-004565.mp3,last week i went hiking in the mountains
./data/Client5\sample-004566.mp3,they're not my children
./data/Client5\sample-004567.mp3,the thought was so dreadful to him that he forgot about the heat and went forward
./data/Client5\sample-004568.mp3,you got to help us
./data/Client5\sample-004569.mp3,at most they thought that another meteorite had descended
./data/Client5\sample-004570.mp3,dense clouds of smoke or dust can be seen through a powerful telescope
./data/Client5\sample-004571.mp3,but he decided first to buy his bakery and put some money aside
./data/Client5\sample-004572.mp3,which one of these men is it
./data/Client5\sample-004573.mp3,i'm through listening to you
./data/Client5\sample-004574.mp3,i'm going to take over a lot of plates and things
./data/Client5\sample-004575.mp3,you can't offer me something that is already mine the chief said arrogantly
./data/Client5\sample-004576.mp3,he won't leave the circle
./data/Client5\sample-004577.mp3,and one or two persons were returning
./data/Client5\sample-004578.mp3,i was disappointed at this inanimate bulk
./data/Client5\sample-004579.mp3,which view would you like
./data/Client5\sample-004580.mp3,you must not let up even after having come so far he continued
./data/Client5\sample-004581.mp3,who gets your vote
./data/Client5\sample-004582.mp3,the boy was startled
./data/Client5\sample-004583.mp3,my greatgrandfather planted this tree
./data/Client5\sample-004584.mp3,imagine if everyone went around transforming lead into gold
./data/Client5\sample-004585.mp3,he really was a king
./data/Client5\sample-004586.mp3,proteins have many functions in the human body
./data/Client5\sample-004587.mp3,april cuddled her lamb
./data/Client5\sample-004588.mp3,you point to a trail of ants leading into the house
./data/Client5\sample-004589.mp3,how do i guess at the future
./data/Client5\sample-004590.mp3,i saw him get it
./data/Client5\sample-004591.mp3,sadly my dream of becoming a squirrel whisperer may never happen
./data/Client5\sample-004592.mp3,a quarter of a million dollars
./data/Client5\sample-004593.mp3,not even a stick of gum
./data/Client5\sample-004594.mp3,the boy continued to listen to his heart as they crossed the desert
./data/Client5\sample-004595.mp3,then the thing came upon him in a flash
./data/Client5\sample-004596.mp3,go into your dance
./data/Client5\sample-004597.mp3,i can't think of any reason why she was killed
./data/Client5\sample-004598.mp3,if you start your emails with greetings let me be the first to welcome you to earth
./data/Client5\sample-004599.mp3,sexuality is a mystery
./data/Client5\sample-004600.mp3,because life wants you to achieve your destiny
./data/Client5\sample-004601.mp3,the animals were exhausted and the men talked among themselves less and less
./data/Client5\sample-004602.mp3,for a moment everything was dark and scary
./data/Client5\sample-004603.mp3,then the thing came upon him in a flash
./data/Client5\sample-004604.mp3,it commenced to blow harder raising the desert sands
./data/Client5\sample-004605.mp3,he wanted your money he said
./data/Client5\sample-004606.mp3,as they sat down at the only table in the place the crystal merchant laughed
./data/Client5\sample-004607.mp3,finally after hours of waiting the guard bade the boy enter
./data/Client5\sample-004608.mp3,the merchant was silent for a few moments
./data/Client5\sample-004609.mp3,he was more confident in himself though and felt as though he could conquer the world
./data/Client5\sample-004610.mp3,and this is for me said the alchemist keeping one of the parts
./data/Client5\sample-004611.mp3,it's called the principle of favorability beginner's luck
./data/Client5\sample-004612.mp3,but that's what you're doing
./data/Client5\sample-004613.mp3,looking around he sought his sheep and then realized that he was in a new world
./data/Client5\sample-004614.mp3,the englishman had been profoundly impressed by the story
./data/Client5\sample-004615.mp3,it was a pleasant change from talking to his sheep
./data/Client5\sample-004616.mp3,all i saw was an army said the boy
./data/Client5\sample-004617.mp3,but i didnt think that it contained any living creature
./data/Client5\sample-004618.mp3,he needed someone to talk to so as to avoid thinking about the possibility of war
./data/Client5\sample-004619.mp3,think i'd better be going
./data/Client5\sample-004620.mp3,he did find it soon after dawn and not far from the sand pits
./data/Client5\sample-004621.mp3,it was as if the world had fallen silent because the boy's soul had
./data/Client5\sample-004622.mp3,but the boy never took his eye off his new friend
./data/Client5\sample-004623.mp3,the shop folks were taking down their shutters and people were opening their bedroom windows
./data/Client5\sample-004624.mp3,upon returning to the wise man he related in detail everything he had seen
./data/Client5\sample-004625.mp3,well why don't we go there right now the boy asked
./data/Client5\sample-004626.mp3,whenever he could he sought out a new road to travel
./data/Client5\sample-004627.mp3,and then he perceived it very slowly
./data/Client5\sample-004628.mp3,looking up he saw a pair of hawks flying high in the sky
./data/Client5\sample-004629.mp3,it was up there
./data/Client5\sample-004630.mp3,the irish man sipped his tea
./data/Client5\sample-004631.mp3,so when i look out over your sands i am also looking at her
./data/Client5\sample-004632.mp3,your heart is alive
./data/Client5\sample-004633.mp3,so the boy was disappointed he decided that he would never again believe in dreams
./data/Client5\sample-004634.mp3,i've been looking for you all morning he said as he led the boy outside
./data/Client5\sample-004635.mp3,my name is melchizedek said the old man
./data/Client5\sample-004636.mp3,the article references previous biometric work in a reasonable way
./data/Client5\sample-004637.mp3,the horseman was completely immobile as was the boy
./data/Client5\sample-004638.mp3,listen to your heart
./data/Client5\sample-004639.mp3,i wanted to sleep a little longer he thought
./data/Client5\sample-004640.mp3,i didn't frisk him
./data/Client5\sample-004641.mp3,turn up the volume
./data/Client5\sample-004642.mp3,got a lot of charm
./data/Client5\sample-004643.mp3,they were strange books
./data/Client5\sample-004644.mp3,it was only when i got this close to it that the strangeness of it was at all evident to me
./data/Client5\sample-004645.mp3,he listened to the wind and felt the stones beneath his feet
./data/Client5\sample-004646.mp3,the boy remembered his dream and suddenly everything was clear to him
./data/Client5\sample-004647.mp3,they set off running wildly into the trees
./data/Client5\sample-004648.mp3,the day was dawning and the shepherd urged his sheep in the direction of the sun
./data/Client5\sample-004649.mp3,even though the sheep didn't teach me to speak arabic
./data/Client5\sample-004650.mp3,you must always know what it is that you want the old king had said
./data/Client5\sample-004651.mp3,the boy knew the desert sensed his fear
./data/Client5\sample-004652.mp3,and they attacked an empty tent
./data/Client5\sample-004653.mp3,the boy's name was santiago
./data/Client5\sample-004654.mp3,robin had some sort of date with tracy
./data/Client5\sample-004655.mp3,please don't make me
./data/Client5\sample-004656.mp3,so that those who have the responsibility for understanding can understand he said
./data/Client5\sample-004657.mp3,men dream more about coming home than about leaving the boy said
./data/Client5\sample-004658.mp3,is it for further automatic processing
./data/Client5\sample-004659.mp3,it picks up on the mike
./data/Client5\sample-004660.mp3,that's what it means
./data/Client5\sample-004661.mp3,did you tell them that funny story you told me yesterday
./data/Client5\sample-004662.mp3,his heart was heavy and he had been melancholy since the previous night
./data/Client5\sample-004663.mp3,just get me home
./data/Client5\sample-004664.mp3,that night there was another jetting out of gas from the distant planet
./data/Client5\sample-004665.mp3,a large portion of the cylinder had been uncovered
./data/Client5\sample-004666.mp3,and he vanished around the corner of the plaza
./data/Client5\sample-004667.mp3,gelato and ice cream are different
./data/Client5\sample-004668.mp3,her honor won't say anything
./data/Client5\sample-004669.mp3,the alchemist probably already knew all that
./data/Client5\sample-004670.mp3,first they tried to find him on their own
./data/Client5\sample-004671.mp3,then he took from his knapsack a bottle of wine and drank some
./data/Client5\sample-004672.mp3,i myself heard nothing of that
./data/Client5\sample-004673.mp3,they called that discovery the master work  it was part liquid and part solid
./data/Client5\sample-004674.mp3,i think it is
./data/Client5\sample-004675.mp3,the book was written in spanish
./data/Client5\sample-004676.mp3,he listened to the wind and felt the stones beneath his feet
./data/Client5\sample-004677.mp3,i like gentle people
./data/Client5\sample-004678.mp3,the boy noticed that the man's clothing was strange
./data/Client5\sample-004679.mp3,he just got a new kite for his birthday
./data/Client5\sample-004680.mp3,what do they want
./data/Client5\sample-004681.mp3,suddenly the monster disappeared
./data/Client5\sample-004682.mp3,i need to sell some wool the boy told the merchant
./data/Client5\sample-004683.mp3,it means only that the heart does what it can the alchemist said
./data/Client5\sample-004684.mp3,both elephants and monkeys have a capable memory
./data/Client5\sample-004685.mp3,why didn't i call you back
./data/Client5\sample-004686.mp3,the tradition teaches men how to cross the desert and how their children should marry
./data/Client5\sample-004687.mp3,taking the jacket out he began to clean the glasses
./data/Client5\sample-004688.mp3,in symmetric cryptography the same key is used for encryption and decryption
./data/Client5\sample-004689.mp3,i think we were wrong about sally having the money
./data/Client5\sample-004690.mp3,i heard a faint movement under my feet
./data/Client5\sample-004691.mp3,it spread through the planet's atmosphere and obscured its more familiar features
./data/Client5\sample-004692.mp3,what's she saying now
./data/Client5\sample-004693.mp3,people said that gypsies spent their lives tricking others
./data/Client5\sample-004694.mp3,that day he didn't make a cast
./data/Client5\sample-004695.mp3,i wish they'd stop that practicing
./data/Client5\sample-004696.mp3,but the englishman appeared not to attach any importance to it
./data/Client5\sample-004697.mp3,the horse reared again raising a cloud of dust
./data/Client5\sample-004698.mp3,he wanted to say so to the alchemist but he was afraid of the man
./data/Client5\sample-004699.mp3,the new law was retroactive
./data/Client5\sample-004700.mp3,and if you improve on the present what comes later will also be better
./data/Client5\sample-004701.mp3,how do i feel
./data/Client5\sample-004702.mp3,everything in life is an omen said the englishman now closing the journal he was reading
./data/Client5\sample-004703.mp3,see you in the funny papers
./data/Client5\sample-004704.mp3,they never found the secret
./data/Client5\sample-004705.mp3,you're looking for witch doctors he spoke some verses from the koran and moved on
./data/Client5\sample-004706.mp3,well usually i learn more from my sheep than from books he answered
./data/Client5\sample-004707.mp3,they are so used to me that they know my schedule he muttered
./data/Client5\sample-004708.mp3,and this is for me said the alchemist keeping one of the parts
./data/Client5\sample-004709.mp3,it was there that the wise man lived
./data/Client5\sample-004710.mp3,they were men of the desert and they were fearful of sorcerers
./data/Client5\sample-004711.mp3,it was such a gradual movement that he found it only by noticing the dots
./data/Client5\sample-004712.mp3,they dismounted and the alchemist said nothing
./data/Client5\sample-004713.mp3,the first rule of don't fight club is let's talk about it
./data/Client5\sample-004714.mp3,they dismounted and the alchemist said nothing
./data/Client5\sample-004715.mp3,he was immensely excited at the news
./data/Client5\sample-004716.mp3,it was the first time either had touched the other
./data/Client5\sample-004717.mp3,i finally have enough money and all the time i need
./data/Client5\sample-004718.mp3,i left my father my mother and the town castle behind
./data/Client5\sample-004719.mp3,let me comb your hair
./data/Client5\sample-004720.mp3,but i'm going in search of my treasure the boy said
./data/Client5\sample-004721.mp3,that rollercoaster was insane
./data/Client5\sample-004722.mp3,what was spoken was totally disregarded
./data/Client5\sample-004723.mp3,he means that he can't really tell you the truth for pr reasons
./data/Client5\sample-004724.mp3,he's home cooking dinner
./data/Client5\sample-004725.mp3,exactly answered the alchemist
./data/Client5\sample-004726.mp3,but they were not there
./data/Client5\sample-004727.mp3,i've been lonely and hungry for something practically all my life
./data/Client5\sample-004728.mp3,that sobered him a little
./data/Client5\sample-004729.mp3,it was dropping off in flakes and raining down on the sand
./data/Client5\sample-004730.mp3,henderson was taking it in
./data/Client5\sample-004731.mp3,he heard a muffled grating sound and saw the black mark jerk forward an inch or so
./data/Client5\sample-004732.mp3,the boy remembered his dream and suddenly everything was clear to him
./data/Client5\sample-004733.mp3,he wants me to write down only things that i think about but not things i plan to do
./data/Client5\sample-004734.mp3,the next day the boy met the old man at noon
./data/Client5\sample-004735.mp3,on the seventh day the alchemist decided to make camp earlier than usual
./data/Client5\sample-004736.mp3,because of the omens the alchemist answered
./data/Client5\sample-004737.mp3,and what do you do in salem he insisted
./data/Client5\sample-004738.mp3,it's awfully clear now
./data/Client5\sample-004739.mp3,this biscuit is yummy
./data/Client5\sample-004740.mp3,we're going to take her over to my private office
./data/Client5\sample-004741.mp3,it brought his heart into his mouth
./data/Client5\sample-004742.mp3,you put something wrong in those capsules
./data/Client5\sample-004743.mp3,maybe because that wasn't really his dream
./data/Client5\sample-004744.mp3,sometimes i appear in the form of a solution or a good idea
./data/Client5\sample-004745.mp3,i need you to be spontaneous he asked me out to din din
./data/Client5\sample-004746.mp3,there was very little talking
./data/Client5\sample-004747.mp3,i'm going out and find them
./data/Client5\sample-004748.mp3,it didn't even occur to the boy to flee
./data/Client5\sample-004749.mp3,i thought about the difficulties in translation that might arise
./data/Client5\sample-004750.mp3,she and the judge are like corned beef and cabbage
./data/Client5\sample-004751.mp3,they had gone away to breakfast at henderson's house
./data/Client5\sample-004752.mp3,it was the levanter the wind that came from africa
./data/Client5\sample-004753.mp3,at once he connected the two incidents
./data/Client5\sample-004754.mp3,as he did so he talked with the monk about the tribal wars
./data/Client5\sample-004755.mp3,hires two personal trainers and make one of them train the other one
./data/Client5\sample-004756.mp3,my review of the sun one star
./data/Client5\sample-004757.mp3,we have also started contemplating the possibility of moving back to colorado
./data/Client5\sample-004758.mp3,i don't want anything for myself
./data/Client5\sample-004759.mp3,this wasn't a strange place it was a new one
./data/Client5\sample-004760.mp3,then came the night of the first falling star
./data/Client5\sample-004761.mp3,before guns were invented armies had to throw bullets at each other and if a bullet touched you you had to sit out until the next war
./data/Client5\sample-004762.mp3,but fatima's hands held to the handles of her jug
./data/Client5\sample-004763.mp3,now i too will be one of the women who wait
./data/Client5\sample-004764.mp3,i thought about the difficulties in translation that might arise
./data/Client5\sample-004765.mp3,but that's why you created the game in the first place the boy answered
./data/Client5\sample-004766.mp3,if we serve tea in crystal the shop is going to expand
./data/Client5\sample-004767.mp3,that makes sense the alchemist answered
./data/Client5\sample-004768.mp3,he was immensely excited at the news
./data/Client5\sample-004769.mp3,the omens will begin insistently to speak of it and you'll try to ignore them
./data/Client5\sample-004770.mp3,his eyes filled with tears as he spoke of the prophet
./data/Client5\sample-004771.mp3,in order to find the treasure you will have to follow the omens
./data/Client5\sample-004772.mp3,they're closing in on you
./data/Client5\sample-004773.mp3,the people will enjoy the tea and want to buy the glasses
./data/Client5\sample-004774.mp3,i went stretching my legs clumsily and feeling my way in the dark
./data/Client5\sample-004775.mp3,you're the one who may die the alchemist said
./data/Client5\sample-004776.mp3,i just don't trust anyone who says they've never had hamburger helper
./data/Client5\sample-004777.mp3,but only speak a word and my servant will be healed
./data/Client5\sample-004778.mp3,the man you had the fight with
./data/Client5\sample-004779.mp3,i'm going to them
./data/Client5\sample-004780.mp3,something bright reflected from his chest with such intensity that the boy was momentarily blinded
./data/Client5\sample-004781.mp3,then taking his sheep he walked away
./data/Client5\sample-004782.mp3,i have been wanting to go and waiting for him to go with me
./data/Client5\sample-004783.mp3,there are a lot of powerful tools and libraries out there
./data/Client5\sample-004784.mp3,one is loved because one is loved
./data/Client5\sample-004785.mp3,we are obliged at least once in our lives to visit the holy city of mecca
./data/Client5\sample-004786.mp3,i think they perceived that nothing was to be done at the moment
./data/Client5\sample-004787.mp3,i need you to be spontaneous he asked me out to din din
./data/Client5\sample-004788.mp3,another hour to write it
./data/Client5\sample-004789.mp3,there was absolutely no reason for her to announce it to the entire company
./data/Client5\sample-004790.mp3,the top had certainly ceased to rotate
./data/Client5\sample-004791.mp3,the soul of the world is nourished by people's happiness
./data/Client5\sample-004792.mp3,crossing your own pals
./data/Client5\sample-004793.mp3,but they could never have taught him arabic
./data/Client5\sample-004794.mp3,ask the owner of that stall how much the sword costs he said to his friend
./data/Client5\sample-004795.mp3,he followed the movement of the birds trying to read something into it
./data/Client5\sample-004796.mp3,i came out of it without a scratch
./data/Client5\sample-004797.mp3,after all who doesnt want to overcome new challenges and achieve great heights
./data/Client5\sample-004798.mp3,and seizing the boy's bag the alchemist gave the gold coins to the chief
./data/Client5\sample-004799.mp3,where'd you meet this man
./data/Client5\sample-004800.mp3,watch over her tonight
./data/Client5\sample-004801.mp3,i was disappointed at this inanimate bulk
./data/Client5\sample-004802.mp3,here it is again
./data/Client5\sample-004803.mp3,like eating or sleeping or like seeking love or finding a job
./data/Client5\sample-004804.mp3,at that time it was quite clear in my own mind that the thing had come from the planet mars
./data/Client5\sample-004805.mp3,you must understand that love never keeps a man from pursuing his destiny
./data/Client5\sample-004806.mp3,that might be all right
./data/Client5\sample-004807.mp3,that baker he said to himself without completing the thought
./data/Client5\sample-004808.mp3,the horizon was tinged with red and suddenly the sun appeared
./data/Client5\sample-004809.mp3,you'll get your money in sixty days
./data/Client5\sample-004810.mp3,well he thought about that the old man said
./data/Client5\sample-004811.mp3,they spoke about mercury salt dragons and kings and he didn't understand any of it
./data/Client5\sample-004812.mp3,when the pan had cooled the monk and the boy looked at it dazzled
./data/Client5\sample-004813.mp3,the infidels had an evil look about them
./data/Client5\sample-004814.mp3,how did you learn to read the girl asked at one point
./data/Client5\sample-004815.mp3,there the alchemist separated the disk into four parts
./data/Client5\sample-004816.mp3,you have enough gold to buy many sheep and many camels
./data/Client5\sample-004817.mp3,absolutely despicable that gingerbread men are forced to live in houses made of their own flesh
./data/Client5\sample-004818.mp3,i have already described the appearance of that colossal bulk which was embedded in the ground
./data/Client5\sample-004819.mp3,the horseman was completely immobile as was the boy
./data/Client5\sample-004820.mp3,i know it's soon to talk about it
./data/Client5\sample-004821.mp3,the scabbard was embossed in silver and the handle was black and encrusted with precious stones
./data/Client5\sample-004822.mp3,among these people were a couple of cyclists a gardener i employed sometimes and a girl carrying a baby
./data/Client5\sample-004823.mp3,over here in the bushes
./data/Client5\sample-004824.mp3,i've had this shop for thirty years
./data/Client5\sample-004825.mp3,this farm had cattle chicken sheep and many other animals
./data/Client5\sample-004826.mp3,during one of these conversations the driver told of his own life
./data/Client5\sample-004827.mp3,i'd like you to take me there if you can
./data/Client5\sample-004828.mp3,they'd never let you go
./data/Client5\sample-004829.mp3,he had never even wept in front of his own sheep
./data/Client5\sample-004830.mp3,they set off running wildly into the trees
./data/Client5\sample-004831.mp3,everyone seemed very excited
./data/Client5\sample-004832.mp3,he wanted to forget about the vision and return to his meditation
./data/Client5\sample-004833.mp3,yet each felt his heart beat a bit faster
./data/Client5\sample-004834.mp3,and my name's michael
./data/Client5\sample-004835.mp3,he was just and good
./data/Client5\sample-004836.mp3,go ahead and have your dinner
./data/Client5\sample-004837.mp3,it was however still so hot from its flight through the air
./data/Client5\sample-004838.mp3,on the very first page it described a burial ceremony
./data/Client5\sample-004839.mp3,people from all over the world have passed through this village son said his father
./data/Client5\sample-004840.mp3,i haven't won my wings yet
./data/Client5\sample-004841.mp3,net neutrality is fundamental to free speech
./data/Client5\sample-004842.mp3,how about driving me home in style
./data/Client5\sample-004843.mp3,other servants maintained the fires in the hookahs
./data/Client5\sample-004844.mp3,the level ground was blackened as far as one could see and it was still giving off smoke
./data/Client5\sample-004845.mp3,i'm just a man who wanders the desert and knows the stars said the alchemist
./data/Client5\sample-004846.mp3,revenge is not my style but obviously accidents will happen
./data/Client5\sample-004847.mp3,i didn't even ask him
./data/Client5\sample-004848.mp3,but finally the merchant appeared and asked the boy to shear four sheep
./data/Client5\sample-004849.mp3,it seemed to him that it fell to earth about one hundred miles east of here
./data/Client5\sample-004850.mp3,they were people of the desert and clamored to hear his stories about the great cities
./data/Client5\sample-004851.mp3,that sobered him a little
./data/Client5\sample-004852.mp3,her manipulation failed
./data/Client5\sample-004853.mp3,it had a diameter of about thirty yards
./data/Client5\sample-004854.mp3,hundreds of observers saw the flame that night and the night after
./data/Client5\sample-004855.mp3,i remember how i sat on the table there in the blackness with patches of green and crimson swimming before my eyes
./data/Client5\sample-004856.mp3,don't let them see that you're afraid the alchemist said
./data/Client5\sample-004857.mp3,its important to keep an open mind and she has urged me to do the same
./data/Client5\sample-004858.mp3,a little token of appreciation
./data/Client5\sample-004859.mp3,just beginning to get an idea what those things mean
./data/Client5\sample-004860.mp3,it spread through the planet's atmosphere and obscured its more familiar features
./data/Client5\sample-004861.mp3,how could it be awkward
./data/Client5\sample-004862.mp3,at his side was the young arab the boy had spoken with earlier
./data/Client5\sample-004863.mp3,everyone should have health insurance
./data/Client5\sample-004864.mp3,the boy listened quietly
./data/Client5\sample-004865.mp3,not everyone can see his dreams come true in the same way
./data/Client5\sample-004866.mp3,she would never know the difference because she didn't know how to read
./data/Client5\sample-004867.mp3,you are almost at the end of your journey said the alchemist
./data/Client5\sample-004868.mp3,a lot of patience but shepherds know all about patience
./data/Client5\sample-004869.mp3,this will help you effectively collaborate with developers and coordinate crossteam projects throughout your career
./data/Client5\sample-004870.mp3,they looked for the fallen mass but found nothing
./data/Client5\sample-004871.mp3,then it became a signal of danger
./data/Client5\sample-004872.mp3,the bank's going to reopen next week
./data/Client5\sample-004873.mp3,the dead soldiers were replaced by others and life went on
./data/Client5\sample-004874.mp3,you can't believe it's not butter
./data/Client5\sample-004875.mp3,help me the boy said
./data/Client5\sample-004876.mp3,add decade in the sun best of stereophonics to laundry
./data/Client5\sample-004877.mp3,the end of the cylinder was still as ogilvy and henderson had left it
./data/Client5\sample-004878.mp3,that night there was another jetting out of gas from the distant planet
./data/Client5\sample-004879.mp3,no one attacks an oasis
./data/Client5\sample-004880.mp3,but he knew that salem wasn't in andalusia
./data/Client5\sample-004881.mp3,suddenly there is so much more time in a day because she no longer has to spend hours commuting
./data/Client5\sample-004882.mp3,you don't have to go with me
./data/Client5\sample-004883.mp3,you forget the power that always watches over the morning post
./data/Client5\sample-004884.mp3,there are many languages spoken by things the boy said
./data/Client5\sample-004885.mp3,i wanted them to be a part of your inheritance
./data/Client5\sample-004886.mp3,the heather was on fire and you could see a thin blue smoke rising up slowly
./data/Client5\sample-004887.mp3,he had no idea how he was going to transform himself into the wind
./data/Client5\sample-004888.mp3,apple pie is an iconic dish
./data/Client5\sample-004889.mp3,the stranger was speaking of things that very few people knew about
./data/Client5\sample-004890.mp3,i had to test your courage the stranger said
./data/Client5\sample-004891.mp3,the boy stood up shakily and looked once more at the pyramids
./data/Client5\sample-004892.mp3,this is the morning post you're talking to
./data/Client5\sample-004893.mp3,because he was terrified the boy didn't answer
./data/Client5\sample-004894.mp3,the animals were exhausted and the men talked among themselves less and less
./data/Client5\sample-004895.mp3,i don't much like change he said
./data/Client5\sample-004896.mp3,the boy had never even noticed that there was a hole in his pouch
./data/Client5\sample-004897.mp3,i don't need any help
./data/Client5\sample-004898.mp3,the boy was surprised
./data/Client5\sample-004899.mp3,come into the office a minute
./data/Client5\sample-004900.mp3,they reminded him of the old man
./data/Client5\sample-004901.mp3,upon returning to the wise man he related in detail everything he had seen
./data/Client5\sample-004902.mp3,the thief wasn't there and the owner brought him a cup of tea
./data/Client5\sample-004903.mp3,much better said the old man
./data/Client5\sample-004904.mp3,you'll watch them as they grow demonstrating how the world is always changing
./data/Client5\sample-004905.mp3,explanations are illogical and confusing
./data/Client5\sample-004906.mp3,about eleven i walked back to my home in maybury because nothing seemed to be happening
./data/Client5\sample-004907.mp3,i'm a sucker for it
./data/Client5\sample-004908.mp3,there were lights in the upper windows of the houses when the people went to bed
./data/Client5\sample-004909.mp3,that's when he'll be safe and not a minute before
./data/Client5\sample-004910.mp3,as i watched the planet seemed to grow larger and smaller
./data/Client5\sample-004911.mp3,an alchemist said the alchemist
./data/Client5\sample-004912.mp3,want to give my flower a drink
./data/Client5\sample-004913.mp3,the wind screamed with delight and blew harder than ever
./data/Client5\sample-004914.mp3,i beg your pardon
./data/Client5\sample-004915.mp3,it looked like a rusty gas float
./data/Client5\sample-004916.mp3,i've got to talk to you straight from the shoulder
./data/Client5\sample-004917.mp3,the terror was palpable
./data/Client5\sample-004918.mp3,the article introduces a very fast small and shallow feedforward network which is trained endtoend
./data/Client5\sample-004919.mp3,because for him you are a green field from which he always returns with game
./data/Client5\sample-004920.mp3,she wrote the stuff
./data/Client5\sample-004921.mp3,then he may be caught on a ledge
./data/Client5\sample-004922.mp3,one afternoon one of his servants fell ill and it appeared that he would die
./data/Client5\sample-004923.mp3,dennis was not a business man
./data/Client5\sample-004924.mp3,that day the merchant gave the boy permission to build the display
./data/Client5\sample-004925.mp3,only in that way would he be able to read the omens
./data/Client5\sample-004926.mp3,but i never said anything like that
./data/Client5\sample-004927.mp3,do you think your boyfriend is cheating on you
./data/Client5\sample-004928.mp3,she cried for an hour
./data/Client5\sample-004929.mp3,i don't want to rush you
./data/Client5\sample-004930.mp3,i am proud of you he said
./data/Client5\sample-004931.mp3,she's kind and sweet and considerate
./data/Client5\sample-004932.mp3,i like icecream
./data/Client5\sample-004933.mp3,first they tried to find him on their own
./data/Client5\sample-004934.mp3,right back at you
./data/Client5\sample-004935.mp3,a line of flame high can be seen in the atmosphere
./data/Client5\sample-004936.mp3,i told you that your dream was a difficult one
./data/Client5\sample-004937.mp3,this is the hardest part of my setup
./data/Client5\sample-004938.mp3,why should i be in any danger
./data/Client5\sample-004939.mp3,that night there was another jetting out of gas from the distant planet
./data/Client5\sample-004940.mp3,you're not asking a favor of him
./data/Client5\sample-004941.mp3,the boy fell to the sand nearly unconscious
./data/Client5\sample-004942.mp3,by letting me help you
./data/Client5\sample-004943.mp3,i've never had one before the merchant answered
./data/Client5\sample-004944.mp3,i'll be next door
./data/Client5\sample-004945.mp3,the boy was relieved
./data/Client5\sample-004946.mp3,it was a surprise to me
./data/Client5\sample-004947.mp3,this morning i found a calculator taped to my wii
./data/Client5\sample-004948.mp3,he had seen the shooting star and was persuaded that a meteorite lay somewhere nearby
./data/Client5\sample-004949.mp3,to measure the performance accurately we need a benchmark
./data/Client5\sample-004950.mp3,he moved about invisible but everyone could hear him
./data/Client5\sample-004951.mp3,my scholarship got rejected
./data/Client5\sample-004952.mp3,they ate in silence
./data/Client5\sample-004953.mp3,i think i sprained my pride
./data/Client5\sample-004954.mp3,it may be the gases of the firing that caused the martians inconvenience
./data/Client5\sample-004955.mp3,the boy closed his book
./data/Client5\sample-004956.mp3,and he wasn't faring much better
./data/Client5\sample-004957.mp3,sometime during the second year you'll remember about the treasure
./data/Client5\sample-004958.mp3,i should thank you
./data/Client5\sample-004959.mp3,an huge hole had been made by the impact of the projectile
./data/Client5\sample-004960.mp3,among these people were a couple of cyclists a gardener i employed sometimes and a girl carrying a baby
./data/Client5\sample-004961.mp3,you can't be the wind the wind said
./data/Client5\sample-004962.mp3,it's late in the evening a perfect time for coffee
./data/Client5\sample-004963.mp3,he reached over and picked up a shell from the ground
./data/Client5\sample-004964.mp3,they erased all evidence of their crimes
./data/Client5\sample-004965.mp3,which one of these men is it
./data/Client5\sample-004966.mp3,the same hand that had brandished the sword now held a whip
./data/Client5\sample-004967.mp3,it was just ripe enough to eat
./data/Client5\sample-004968.mp3,they'll believe him
./data/Client5\sample-004969.mp3,dense clouds of smoke or dust can be seen through a powerful telescope
./data/Client5\sample-004970.mp3,the alchemist removed the pan from the fire and set it aside to cool
./data/Client5\sample-004971.mp3,and you know it
./data/Client5\sample-004972.mp3,what's its value today
./data/Client5\sample-004973.mp3,the soul of the world is nourished by people's happiness
./data/Client5\sample-004974.mp3,he doesn't have anything else
./data/Client5\sample-004975.mp3,i just want to dream about mecca
./data/Client5\sample-004976.mp3,it was as if the world had fallen silent because the boy's soul had
./data/Client5\sample-004977.mp3,if he abandons that pursuit it's because it wasn't truelove
./data/Client5\sample-004978.mp3,one that will write
./data/Client5\sample-004979.mp3,you lived your life in a loving way and died with dignity
./data/Client5\sample-004980.mp3,i don't know what it is
./data/Client5\sample-004981.mp3,i want to see him do it said the chief
./data/Client5\sample-004982.mp3,it was seen early in the morning rushing over eastward
./data/Client5\sample-004983.mp3,there was no way to measure anything of that length
./data/Client5\sample-004984.mp3,the cover of the magazine showed a cute puppy
./data/Client5\sample-004985.mp3,go to this address
./data/Client5\sample-004986.mp3,you already know about alchemy
./data/Client5\sample-004987.mp3,and eventually man will nourish your sands where the game will once again flourish
./data/Client5\sample-004988.mp3,now he was here not with his flock but with a shovel
./data/Client5\sample-004989.mp3,your eyes show the strength of your soul answered the alchemist
./data/Client5\sample-004990.mp3,the cistern was malfunctioning
./data/Client5\sample-004991.mp3,finally after hours of waiting the guard bade the boy enter
./data/Client5\sample-004992.mp3,it had toppled over the brim and fallen into the pit
./data/Client5\sample-004993.mp3,when the lead had become liquid the alchemist took from his pouch the strange yellow egg
./data/Client5\sample-004994.mp3,i'm going away he said
./data/Client5\sample-004995.mp3,'m all about those invisible cosmic connections that transcend time and distance
./data/Client5\sample-004996.mp3,the arrow was pointing to the exit
./data/Client5\sample-004997.mp3,it left a greenish streak that glowed for some seconds
./data/Client5\sample-004998.mp3,and your camels will bring you wealth and power
./data/Client5\sample-004999.mp3,i'm going to them
