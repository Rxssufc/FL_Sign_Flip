./data/Client3\sample-002000.mp3,go ahead and have your dinner
./data/Client3\sample-002001.mp3,they began to ride out over the sands with the moon lighting their way
./data/Client3\sample-002002.mp3,he did find it soon after dawn and not far from the sand pits
./data/Client3\sample-002003.mp3,the complimentary refreshments were satisfactory
./data/Client3\sample-002004.mp3,that's the magic of omens said the boy
./data/Client3\sample-002005.mp3,the families will be here soon
./data/Client3\sample-002006.mp3,did you learn anything the englishman asked eager to hear what it might be
./data/Client3\sample-002007.mp3,i want you to be my wife
./data/Client3\sample-002008.mp3,from here on you will be alone the alchemist said
./data/Client3\sample-002009.mp3,that makes sense the alchemist answered
./data/Client3\sample-002010.mp3,the only shadow was that of the few scattered pine trees
./data/Client3\sample-002011.mp3,i was torn between fear and curiosity
./data/Client3\sample-002012.mp3,how did peter lovelace get that gun
./data/Client3\sample-002013.mp3,the first rule of don't fight club is let's talk about it
./data/Client3\sample-002014.mp3,the volume wouldn't increase much further
./data/Client3\sample-002015.mp3,what is it you're looking for asked the old merchant
./data/Client3\sample-002016.mp3,there are rumors of tribal wars he told them
./data/Client3\sample-002017.mp3,what would you do if it was a daughter
./data/Client3\sample-002018.mp3,and you've told me nothing along the way said the boy
./data/Client3\sample-002019.mp3,i think they perceived that nothing was to be done at the moment
./data/Client3\sample-002020.mp3,he felt uneasy at the man's presence
./data/Client3\sample-002021.mp3,the boy's heart began to speak of fear
./data/Client3\sample-002022.mp3,now that's too much
./data/Client3\sample-002023.mp3,they set off running wildly into the trees
./data/Client3\sample-002024.mp3,the problem is that they don't even realize that they're walking a new road every day
./data/Client3\sample-002025.mp3,it's almost as if he had been here and left his mark he thought
./data/Client3\sample-002026.mp3,another trick the boy thought
./data/Client3\sample-002027.mp3,carol hid inside the shipping container
./data/Client3\sample-002028.mp3,it belongs to me now
./data/Client3\sample-002029.mp3,the turf and gravel around it seemed charred as if by a sudden explosion
./data/Client3\sample-002030.mp3,at most they thought that another meteorite had descended
./data/Client3\sample-002031.mp3,air was either entering or escaping at the rim with a thin sizzling sound
./data/Client3\sample-002032.mp3,when he reached the top of the dune his heart leapt
./data/Client3\sample-002033.mp3,who do you think
./data/Client3\sample-002034.mp3,everything i say is right
./data/Client3\sample-002035.mp3,that's why i'm quitting
./data/Client3\sample-002036.mp3,the boy was shocked
./data/Client3\sample-002037.mp3,what's the world's greatest lie the boy asked completely surprised
./data/Client3\sample-002038.mp3,i am following my destiny
./data/Client3\sample-002039.mp3,the desert takes our men from us and they don't always return she said
./data/Client3\sample-002040.mp3,you'll use your knowledge for the welfare of the oasis and its inhabitants
./data/Client3\sample-002041.mp3,they looked for the fallen mass but found nothing
./data/Client3\sample-002042.mp3,i locked eyes with a fish in the tank
./data/Client3\sample-002043.mp3,these scissors can cut metal
./data/Client3\sample-002044.mp3,he walked slowly through the market
./data/Client3\sample-002045.mp3,some place to live
./data/Client3\sample-002046.mp3,pencils down time is over
./data/Client3\sample-002047.mp3,tell nathan to get on the extension
./data/Client3\sample-002048.mp3,maybe this is an omen said the englishman half aloud
./data/Client3\sample-002049.mp3,and at that i told him and he took my place
./data/Client3\sample-002050.mp3,didn't you hear him
./data/Client3\sample-002051.mp3,even then he hardly understood what this meant
./data/Client3\sample-002052.mp3,the newspaper articles had prepared everyone for the reception of the idea
./data/Client3\sample-002053.mp3,there's just so much a body can do
./data/Client3\sample-002054.mp3,that doesn't happen to just anyone
./data/Client3\sample-002055.mp3,and if you improve on the present what comes later will also be better
./data/Client3\sample-002056.mp3,glaciers are melting because of global warming
./data/Client3\sample-002057.mp3,the sun was setting when the boy's heart sounded a danger signal
./data/Client3\sample-002058.mp3,i just don't trust anyone who says they've never had hamburger helper
./data/Client3\sample-002059.mp3,reindeer and antelopes are missing in your taxonomy of animals
./data/Client3\sample-002060.mp3,and she already has her treasure it's you
./data/Client3\sample-002061.mp3,the hunter was alerted by the sound of rustling vegetation behind her
./data/Client3\sample-002062.mp3,go and speak to the tribal chieftains said the camel driver
./data/Client3\sample-002063.mp3,you must not let up even after having come so far he continued
./data/Client3\sample-002064.mp3,without such love one's dreams would have no meaning
./data/Client3\sample-002065.mp3,it was a pleasant change from talking to his sheep
./data/Client3\sample-002066.mp3,don't you think i know where i live
./data/Client3\sample-002067.mp3,as i watched the planet seemed to grow larger and smaller
./data/Client3\sample-002068.mp3,you've got the brain of a pancake
./data/Client3\sample-002069.mp3,i'm beginning to think women make the best spies
./data/Client3\sample-002070.mp3,he arose and taking up his crook began to awaken the sheep that still slept
./data/Client3\sample-002071.mp3,an army is coming the boy said
./data/Client3\sample-002072.mp3,there was a small building there with a window at which people bought tickets to africa
./data/Client3\sample-002073.mp3,foxes are really intelligent creatures
./data/Client3\sample-002074.mp3,look at those shoulders
./data/Client3\sample-002075.mp3,he just got a new kite for his birthday
./data/Client3\sample-002076.mp3,what are you talking about
./data/Client3\sample-002077.mp3,it's going to take a while the boy said
./data/Client3\sample-002078.mp3,he knelt down to find urim and thummim and put them back in the pouch
./data/Client3\sample-002079.mp3,with every day that passed the boy's heart became more and more silent
./data/Client3\sample-002080.mp3,and don't bump into anything
./data/Client3\sample-002081.mp3,few people realise the immensity of vacancy
./data/Client3\sample-002082.mp3,was it my fault
./data/Client3\sample-002083.mp3,well then stand up
./data/Client3\sample-002084.mp3,the gods should not have desires because they don't have destinies
./data/Client3\sample-002085.mp3,it's true that everything has its destiny but one day that destiny will be realized
./data/Client3\sample-002086.mp3,the end of the cylinder was still as ogilvy and henderson had left it
./data/Client3\sample-002087.mp3,there was surely a baker in her town
./data/Client3\sample-002088.mp3,if i could i'd write a huge encyclopedia just about the words luck and coincidence
./data/Client3\sample-002089.mp3,love required them to stay with the people they loved
./data/Client3\sample-002090.mp3,some went away while i was there and other people came
./data/Client3\sample-002091.mp3,the priest collapsed backwards
./data/Client3\sample-002092.mp3,of course the two were unable to do anything
./data/Client3\sample-002093.mp3,queuing is something the british excel at
./data/Client3\sample-002094.mp3,i'll see you after
./data/Client3\sample-002095.mp3,my tax dollars pay for those public school proms
./data/Client3\sample-002096.mp3,there's life here the boy said to the alchemist
./data/Client3\sample-002097.mp3,they become the soul o f the world
./data/Client3\sample-002098.mp3,now his intuition was that he had been right in coming
./data/Client3\sample-002099.mp3,they never have to make any decisions he thought
./data/Client3\sample-002100.mp3,it was faintly marked with transverse stripes and slightly flattened from the perfect round
./data/Client3\sample-002101.mp3,any statement on the red uprising tomorrow
./data/Client3\sample-002102.mp3,it spread through the planet's atmosphere and obscured its more familiar features
./data/Client3\sample-002103.mp3,they looked for the fallen mass but found nothing
./data/Client3\sample-002104.mp3,i would appreciate if you could create a concise table
./data/Client3\sample-002105.mp3,were you paid for it or weren't you
./data/Client3\sample-002106.mp3,they're not for sale he said
./data/Client3\sample-002107.mp3,that's a good luck omen the englishman said after the fat arab had gone out
./data/Client3\sample-002108.mp3,the stranger seemed satisfied with the answer
./data/Client3\sample-002109.mp3,ten years at the university and here i am in a corral
./data/Client3\sample-002110.mp3,absolutely despicable that gingerbread men are forced to live in houses made of their own flesh
./data/Client3\sample-002111.mp3,everything in life is an omen said the englishman now closing the journal he was reading
./data/Client3\sample-002112.mp3,until one of them dies i couldn't possibly meet anyone else
./data/Client3\sample-002113.mp3,they must be used to their new shepherd and have probably already forgotten me
./data/Client3\sample-002114.mp3,this was my destiny not yours the alchemist answered
./data/Client3\sample-002115.mp3,'everyone loved them and enjoyed them
./data/Client3\sample-002116.mp3,he had assumed he would soon return to his sheep
./data/Client3\sample-002117.mp3,ogilvy told him everything that he had seen
./data/Client3\sample-002118.mp3,imagine if everyone went around transforming lead into gold
./data/Client3\sample-002119.mp3,but he still couldn't flee
./data/Client3\sample-002120.mp3,dusk was falling as the boy arrived with his herd at an abandoned church
./data/Client3\sample-002121.mp3,there's that reprieve if they ever find out
./data/Client3\sample-002122.mp3,he knew how to shear them and how to slaughter them
./data/Client3\sample-002123.mp3,the same hand that had brandished the sword now held a whip
./data/Client3\sample-002124.mp3,dense clouds of smoke or dust can be seen through a powerful telescope
./data/Client3\sample-002125.mp3,you're a man disgusted with all of civilization
./data/Client3\sample-002126.mp3,i was torn between fear and curiosity
./data/Client3\sample-002127.mp3,the next day the boy met the old man at noon
./data/Client3\sample-002128.mp3,and in that way the months passed
./data/Client3\sample-002129.mp3,i need it to get to the pyramids he said
./data/Client3\sample-002130.mp3,the boy was trying to understand the truth of what the old man had said
./data/Client3\sample-002131.mp3,it was starlight and i explained the signs of the zodiac to her
./data/Client3\sample-002132.mp3,the englishman was disappointed
./data/Client3\sample-002133.mp3,the two walked out among the palms
./data/Client3\sample-002134.mp3,he was immensely excited at the news
./data/Client3\sample-002135.mp3,that's why i'm here
./data/Client3\sample-002136.mp3,the secretary tugged at a loose fibre
./data/Client3\sample-002137.mp3,he was alarmed by what had happened
./data/Client3\sample-002138.mp3,he couldn't have been wrong
./data/Client3\sample-002139.mp3,everybody quiet and ready for an emergency
./data/Client3\sample-002140.mp3,one must prepare for it
./data/Client3\sample-002141.mp3,and he asked the boy if he too were in search of the alchemist
./data/Client3\sample-002142.mp3,the two men hurried back and found the cylinder still lying in the same position
./data/Client3\sample-002143.mp3,ogilvy told him everything that he had seen
./data/Client3\sample-002144.mp3,there were raised voicesand some sort of struggle appeared to be going on 
./data/Client3\sample-002145.mp3,it took her a while to get used to it
./data/Client3\sample-002146.mp3,judge tully is in
./data/Client3\sample-002147.mp3,you don't have to be rich skinny popular or even own a cape to perform a random act of kindness
./data/Client3\sample-002148.mp3,fatima was more important than his treasure
./data/Client3\sample-002149.mp3,why don't you have your friends join us
./data/Client3\sample-002150.mp3,and the murmur lasted longer than a simple vow would have
./data/Client3\sample-002151.mp3,it's the other foreigner the englishman
./data/Client3\sample-002152.mp3,i was just asking
./data/Client3\sample-002153.mp3,melchizedek watched a small ship that was plowing its way out of the port
./data/Client3\sample-002154.mp3,but bakers are more important people than shepherds
./data/Client3\sample-002155.mp3,you just pat him
./data/Client3\sample-002156.mp3,i dreamt i was your father
./data/Client3\sample-002157.mp3,he came to understand its dodges and tricks and to accept it as it was
./data/Client3\sample-002158.mp3,i'm on the job
./data/Client3\sample-002159.mp3,i'll see you get it in fifteen minutes
./data/Client3\sample-002160.mp3,his eyes filled with tears as he spoke of the prophet
./data/Client3\sample-002161.mp3,i'll work all night until dawn and i'll clean every piece of crystal in your shop
./data/Client3\sample-002162.mp3,among these people were a couple of cyclists a gardener i employed sometimes and a girl carrying a baby
./data/Client3\sample-002163.mp3,we've got her located
./data/Client3\sample-002164.mp3,march was windy and dark
./data/Client3\sample-002165.mp3,a thin circle of bright metal showed between the top and the body of the cylinder
./data/Client3\sample-002166.mp3,people say strange things the boy thought
./data/Client3\sample-002167.mp3,the angel touched the man's shoulder and they were both projected far into the future
./data/Client3\sample-002168.mp3,what had been next to him five minutes ago was now at the other side
./data/Client3\sample-002169.mp3,he remembered something his grandfather had once told him that butterflies were a good omen
./data/Client3\sample-002170.mp3,that sobered him a little
./data/Client3\sample-002171.mp3,most meteorites are more or less rounded
./data/Client3\sample-002172.mp3,then one day the boy returned the books to the englishman
./data/Client3\sample-002173.mp3,i want to look at my flower
./data/Client3\sample-002174.mp3,listen to your heart
./data/Client3\sample-002175.mp3,they called that discovery the master work  it was part liquid and part solid
./data/Client3\sample-002176.mp3,he did find it soon after dawn and not far from the sand pits
./data/Client3\sample-002177.mp3,when the blinding dust had settled a bit the boy trembled at what he saw
./data/Client3\sample-002178.mp3,what had been next to him five minutes ago was now at the other side
./data/Client3\sample-002179.mp3,the boy recalled the brilliance he had noticed on the previous day
./data/Client3\sample-002180.mp3,the baby definitely has the sniffles
./data/Client3\sample-002181.mp3,i am in search of that universal language among other things
./data/Client3\sample-002182.mp3,neighbors moved away and there remained only a few small shops on the hill
./data/Client3\sample-002183.mp3,the boy was trying to understand the truth of what the old man had said
./data/Client3\sample-002184.mp3,the alchemist rode in front with the falcon on his shoulder
./data/Client3\sample-002185.mp3,he approached the mass and was surprised at the size and the shape
./data/Client3\sample-002186.mp3,but he didn't need to worry about that right now
./data/Client3\sample-002187.mp3,at once he connected the two incidents
./data/Client3\sample-002188.mp3,in any case the desert was impassable
./data/Client3\sample-002189.mp3,but now the sounds inside had stopped
./data/Client3\sample-002190.mp3,what have you done with them
./data/Client3\sample-002191.mp3,he forgets the office when he's with me
./data/Client3\sample-002192.mp3,did she ever marry the girl
./data/Client3\sample-002193.mp3,the boy smiled and continued digging
./data/Client3\sample-002194.mp3,the genies were the spirits of good and evil
./data/Client3\sample-002195.mp3,the peak of this mountain is over two thousand meters above sea level
./data/Client3\sample-002196.mp3,it helped me to trust in people the englishman answered
./data/Client3\sample-002197.mp3,the boy was startled
./data/Client3\sample-002198.mp3,but the boy knew that he was referring to fatima
./data/Client3\sample-002199.mp3,i was right there and saw it with my own eyes
./data/Client3\sample-002200.mp3,what is it that i still need to know the boy asked
./data/Client3\sample-002201.mp3,they looked for the fallen mass but found nothing
./data/Client3\sample-002202.mp3,at that time it was quite clear in my own mind that the thing had come from the planet mars
./data/Client3\sample-002203.mp3,sidelights on sheriff hartman's manhunt
./data/Client3\sample-002204.mp3,what's the world's greatest lie the boy asked completely surprised
./data/Client3\sample-002205.mp3,and one or two persons were returning
./data/Client3\sample-002206.mp3,it was difficult not to think about what he had left behind
./data/Client3\sample-002207.mp3,he walked slowly through the market
./data/Client3\sample-002208.mp3,don't say anything fatima interrupted
./data/Client3\sample-002209.mp3,handle that with kid gloves
./data/Client3\sample-002210.mp3,you point to a trail of ants leading into the house
./data/Client3\sample-002211.mp3,it should provided results comparable to the state of the art
./data/Client3\sample-002212.mp3,i waited all afternoon and evening he said
./data/Client3\sample-002213.mp3,bush leagues mostly
./data/Client3\sample-002214.mp3,we lit the lantern and walked over to his house
./data/Client3\sample-002215.mp3,i've got indigestion
./data/Client3\sample-002216.mp3,it brought his heart into his mouth
./data/Client3\sample-002217.mp3,i noticed that the boy answered
./data/Client3\sample-002218.mp3,maybe it was yesterday
./data/Client3\sample-002219.mp3,and tomorrow his enemy would also be a part of that soul
./data/Client3\sample-002220.mp3,where's ashley's wallet
./data/Client3\sample-002221.mp3,i'm a desert woman and i'm proud of that
./data/Client3\sample-002222.mp3,i don't care what you say
./data/Client3\sample-002223.mp3,he didn't know the man yet but his practiced eye would recognize him when he appeared
./data/Client3\sample-002224.mp3,the englishman prodded him and the boy asked her about the man who cured people's illnesses
./data/Client3\sample-002225.mp3,it had a diameter of about thirty yards
./data/Client3\sample-002226.mp3,as independent studies document the neanderthals developed simple tools such as spears
./data/Client3\sample-002227.mp3,he was immensely excited at the news
./data/Client3\sample-002228.mp3,what's the matter
./data/Client3\sample-002229.mp3,and seizing the boy's bag the alchemist gave the gold coins to the chief
./data/Client3\sample-002230.mp3,the boy told him then that he needed to get to the pyramids
./data/Client3\sample-002231.mp3,thank you for reading this out loud
./data/Client3\sample-002232.mp3,then suddenly he noticed it with a start
./data/Client3\sample-002233.mp3,it was no more exciting than an overturned carriage or a tree blown across the road
./data/Client3\sample-002234.mp3,well what good would it be to you if you had t die the alchemist answered
./data/Client3\sample-002235.mp3,it was very hard for her to focus
./data/Client3\sample-002236.mp3,i didn't do it
./data/Client3\sample-002237.mp3,who's this gal she's gonna marry
./data/Client3\sample-002238.mp3,revenge is not my style but obviously accidents will happen
./data/Client3\sample-002239.mp3,when i had my sheep i was happy and i made those around me happy
./data/Client3\sample-002240.mp3,it was as if it quivered but really this was the telescope vibrating
./data/Client3\sample-002241.mp3,it wasn't there
./data/Client3\sample-002242.mp3,and don't pull that on me neither
./data/Client3\sample-002243.mp3,something inside the cylinder was unscrewing the top
./data/Client3\sample-002244.mp3,my seven year resume gap is marked not drugs
./data/Client3\sample-002245.mp3,flowers or another magazine subscription
./data/Client3\sample-002246.mp3,don't let them see that you're afraid the alchemist said
./data/Client3\sample-002247.mp3,three days from now he would be with the merchant's daughter
./data/Client3\sample-002248.mp3,only in that way would he be able to read the omens
./data/Client3\sample-002249.mp3,my seven year resume gap is marked not drugs
./data/Client3\sample-002250.mp3,i'm going with you the boy said
./data/Client3\sample-002251.mp3,have you got it
./data/Client3\sample-002252.mp3,i'm an old superstitious arab and i believe in our proverbs
./data/Client3\sample-002253.mp3,they provided warnings about thieves and barbarian tribes
./data/Client3\sample-002254.mp3,the incantation was written in italics
./data/Client3\sample-002255.mp3,i don't want anything for myself
./data/Client3\sample-002256.mp3,the wind has many names
./data/Client3\sample-002257.mp3,i wished i had a light to smoke by
./data/Client3\sample-002258.mp3,he noticed the unequal cooling of its surface
./data/Client3\sample-002259.mp3,give me my book the boy said
./data/Client3\sample-002260.mp3,would you like a cappuccino
./data/Client3\sample-002261.mp3,a large piece suddenly came off and fell with a loud and sharp noise
./data/Client3\sample-002262.mp3,they placed it in a wooden box and left it there for good
./data/Client3\sample-002263.mp3,you got to help us
./data/Client3\sample-002264.mp3,but this payment goes well beyond my generosity the monk responded
./data/Client3\sample-002265.mp3,the boy stood up shakily and looked once more at the pyramids
./data/Client3\sample-002266.mp3,but just before lunchtime a boy stopped in front of the shop
./data/Client3\sample-002267.mp3,on top of all that the weeds keep growing and the garbage has to be taken out
./data/Client3\sample-002268.mp3,one can imagine these two covered with sand running up the little street in the bright sunlight
./data/Client3\sample-002269.mp3,i'm so hungry i could faint
./data/Client3\sample-002270.mp3,and at that i told him and he took my place
./data/Client3\sample-002271.mp3,you got someplace to sleep
./data/Client3\sample-002272.mp3,it spread through the planet's atmosphere and obscured its more familiar features
./data/Client3\sample-002273.mp3,it spread through the planet's atmosphere and obscured its more familiar features
./data/Client3\sample-002274.mp3,the monk laughed when he saw me come back in tatters
./data/Client3\sample-002275.mp3,no doubt the impact had caused a flash of fire
./data/Client3\sample-002276.mp3,perhaps she met somebody
./data/Client3\sample-002277.mp3,from that day on it was the desert that would be important
./data/Client3\sample-002278.mp3,if you pay attention to the present you can improve upon it
./data/Client3\sample-002279.mp3,i'm just a fool
./data/Client3\sample-002280.mp3,i'll take mine now
./data/Client3\sample-002281.mp3,the boy laughed  out of happiness
./data/Client3\sample-002282.mp3,we don't know what's in the confounded thing do you
./data/Client3\sample-002283.mp3,the boy was suddenly happy to be there at the warehouse
./data/Client3\sample-002284.mp3,after all who doesnt want to overcome new challenges and achieve great heights
./data/Client3\sample-002285.mp3,and ask for a glass of wine for me
./data/Client3\sample-002286.mp3,the stranger was speaking of things that very few people knew about
./data/Client3\sample-002287.mp3,he fell asleep and when he awoke the sun was already high
./data/Client3\sample-002288.mp3,how much is your equity in it
./data/Client3\sample-002289.mp3,is there a crowd in the street
./data/Client3\sample-002290.mp3,the top had certainly ceased to rotate
./data/Client3\sample-002291.mp3,the line forms on the right
./data/Client3\sample-002292.mp3,tell them mrs craig is here
./data/Client3\sample-002293.mp3,throughout the night the boy dug at the place he had chosen but found nothing
./data/Client3\sample-002294.mp3,dense clouds of smoke or dust can be seen through a powerful telescope
./data/Client3\sample-002295.mp3,the shop was busy and the man asked the shepherd to wait until the afternoon
./data/Client3\sample-002296.mp3,she didn't have one
./data/Client3\sample-002297.mp3,one can imagine these two covered with sand running up the little street in the bright sunlight
./data/Client3\sample-002298.mp3,at most they thought that another meteorite had descended
./data/Client3\sample-002299.mp3,he disappeared into the tent
./data/Client3\sample-002300.mp3,the men fell into an animated discussion
./data/Client3\sample-002301.mp3,the boy's name was santiago
./data/Client3\sample-002302.mp3,he decided to stay right there and await his return
./data/Client3\sample-002303.mp3,it's not easy to find the philosopher's stone said the englishman
./data/Client3\sample-002304.mp3,a current of love rushed from his heart and the boy began to pray
./data/Client3\sample-002305.mp3,you must not let up even after having come so far he continued
./data/Client3\sample-002306.mp3,i pointed out mars a bright dot of light
./data/Client3\sample-002307.mp3,then he dropped his spade picked up his jacket and came out into the road
./data/Client3\sample-002308.mp3,of course it is
./data/Client3\sample-002309.mp3,i got drunk yesterday and thought i built a super computer
./data/Client3\sample-002310.mp3,when did you get back
./data/Client3\sample-002311.mp3,she must have known alex pretty well
./data/Client3\sample-002312.mp3,the old man wore a breastplate of gold and he knew about my past
./data/Client3\sample-002313.mp3,you can't offer me something that is already mine the chief said arrogantly
./data/Client3\sample-002314.mp3,my chinchilla eats bread
./data/Client3\sample-002315.mp3,he moved about invisible but everyone could hear him
./data/Client3\sample-002316.mp3,what is a foreigner doing here asked another of the men
./data/Client3\sample-002317.mp3,the man was speaking the language of alchemy
./data/Client3\sample-002318.mp3,so how will we name all these hurricanes
./data/Client3\sample-002319.mp3,the tropic of capricorn is on the southern hemisphere of the earth
./data/Client3\sample-002320.mp3,it doesn't have to rhyme
./data/Client3\sample-002321.mp3,how do you like that
./data/Client3\sample-002322.mp3,it left a greenish streak that glowed for some seconds
./data/Client3\sample-002323.mp3,why didn't they wake me
./data/Client3\sample-002324.mp3,inverse kinematics are a mathematical challenge for robot engineers
./data/Client3\sample-002325.mp3,the following night the boy appeared at the alchemist's tent with a horse
./data/Client3\sample-002326.mp3,enough said the boy
./data/Client3\sample-002327.mp3,and better still to be alone with one's books
./data/Client3\sample-002328.mp3,the boy awoke as the sun rose
./data/Client3\sample-002329.mp3,how can i ever face him
./data/Client3\sample-002330.mp3,i had a momentary impulse to go back and help him but i was too scared to do anything
./data/Client3\sample-002331.mp3,the time must have been somewhere around six o'clock
./data/Client3\sample-002332.mp3,he didn't know the man yet but his practiced eye would recognize him when he appeared
./data/Client3\sample-002333.mp3,from the railway station in the distance came the sound of trains ringing and rumbling
./data/Client3\sample-002334.mp3,the fine manufacturing company was a bookkeeper for fourteen years
./data/Client3\sample-002335.mp3,what's the world's greatest lie the boy asked completely surprised
./data/Client3\sample-002336.mp3,but i didnt think that it contained any living creature
./data/Client3\sample-002337.mp3,a large portion of the cylinder had been uncovered
./data/Client3\sample-002338.mp3,instead the stranger lowered it slowly until the point touched the boy's forehead
./data/Client3\sample-002339.mp3,the volume wouldn't increase much further
./data/Client3\sample-002340.mp3,i would have won the junior olympics if not for those medaling kids
./data/Client3\sample-002341.mp3,there were really i think two or three hundred people elbowing one another
./data/Client3\sample-002342.mp3,now his intuition was that he had been right in coming
./data/Client3\sample-002343.mp3,the boy didn't know what to say
./data/Client3\sample-002344.mp3,of course the two were unable to do anything
./data/Client3\sample-002345.mp3,remember to take your full course of antibiotics stopping early is dangerous for your health
./data/Client3\sample-002346.mp3,and then he would ask us to go back to our easels and replicate all the techniques in one go
./data/Client3\sample-002347.mp3,besides that there was a heap of bicycles
./data/Client3\sample-002348.mp3,he felt weighted down by the centuries of time since the pyramids had been built
./data/Client3\sample-002349.mp3,hang on a second
./data/Client3\sample-002350.mp3,another dreamer said the ticket seller to his assistant watching the boy walk away
./data/Client3\sample-002351.mp3,and one or two persons were returning
./data/Client3\sample-002352.mp3,it had a diameter of about thirty yards
./data/Client3\sample-002353.mp3,the proposed approach provides stateoftheart results at very low computational cost
./data/Client3\sample-002354.mp3,the years of research the magic symbols the strange words and the laboratory equipment
./data/Client3\sample-002355.mp3,they locked themselves in their laboratories and tried to evolve as gold had
./data/Client3\sample-002356.mp3,i've got to go to him
./data/Client3\sample-002357.mp3,some people prefer not to quantify their feelings that way
./data/Client3\sample-002358.mp3,you already know all you need to know
./data/Client3\sample-002359.mp3,something older than humanity more ancient than the desert
./data/Client3\sample-002360.mp3,he fondled his bright orange beard
./data/Client3\sample-002361.mp3,i'm trying to explain to my mother how to get pictures off her phone
./data/Client3\sample-002362.mp3,it's not what enters men's mouths that's evil said the alchemist
./data/Client3\sample-002363.mp3,no one seemed to have thought about it that night
./data/Client3\sample-002364.mp3,he listened to the wind and felt the stones beneath his feet
./data/Client3\sample-002365.mp3,i pointed out mars a bright dot of light
./data/Client3\sample-002366.mp3,the first concern is to patch the holes in the ship then we can pump out the water
./data/Client3\sample-002367.mp3,then get out of here
./data/Client3\sample-002368.mp3,the book was written in spanish
./data/Client3\sample-002369.mp3,it's called the principle of favorability
./data/Client3\sample-002370.mp3,there was a rough patch of skin
./data/Client3\sample-002371.mp3,we'll get you out in ten minutes
./data/Client3\sample-002372.mp3,if a person is living out his destiny he knows everything he needs to know
./data/Client3\sample-002373.mp3,the woman was silent for some time
./data/Client3\sample-002374.mp3,the land was ruined and i had to find some other way to earn a living
./data/Client3\sample-002375.mp3,with every day that passed the boy's heart became more and more silent
./data/Client3\sample-002376.mp3,i was just going to
./data/Client3\sample-002377.mp3,they tell their incredible stories at the time when you want to hear them
./data/Client3\sample-002378.mp3,i had seen all that it would presently bring me
./data/Client3\sample-002379.mp3,it was as if it quivered but really this was the telescope vibrating
./data/Client3\sample-002380.mp3,this peach tart is tasty
./data/Client3\sample-002381.mp3,the sun thought about that and decided to shine more brightly
./data/Client3\sample-002382.mp3,the only tribesman spared was the commander of the battalion
./data/Client3\sample-002383.mp3,she hoisted up the pirate flag
./data/Client3\sample-002384.mp3,i was disappointed at this inanimate bulk
./data/Client3\sample-002385.mp3,it's no miracle because i see it happen once every year
./data/Client3\sample-002386.mp3,a boy came running towards me
./data/Client3\sample-002387.mp3,how much is it worth
./data/Client3\sample-002388.mp3,try to fix that fissure with glue
./data/Client3\sample-002389.mp3,the man wept with happiness
./data/Client3\sample-002390.mp3,i'm not good enough to make this one up
./data/Client3\sample-002391.mp3,i'd like you to take me there if you can
./data/Client3\sample-002392.mp3,death doesn't change anything the boy thought
./data/Client3\sample-002393.mp3,down below in the darkness were hundreds of people sleeping in peace
./data/Client3\sample-002394.mp3,it was glaringly hot not a cloud in the sky nor a breath of wind
./data/Client3\sample-002395.mp3,they never found the secret
./data/Client3\sample-002396.mp3,we want to see you
./data/Client3\sample-002397.mp3,i thought you were chasing me
./data/Client3\sample-002398.mp3,do you know someone here who cures people's illnesses the boy asked
./data/Client3\sample-002399.mp3,this man claims he was kidnapped
./data/Client3\sample-002400.mp3,strange images passed through my mind
./data/Client3\sample-002401.mp3,the boy remembered his dream and suddenly everything was clear to him
./data/Client3\sample-002402.mp3,he also tried to remember some good stories to relate as he sheared the sheep
./data/Client3\sample-002403.mp3,i guess you're right
./data/Client3\sample-002404.mp3,and in that mood he was grateful to be in love
./data/Client3\sample-002405.mp3,you bet i will
./data/Client3\sample-002406.mp3,do you think steven would have let you keep it
./data/Client3\sample-002407.mp3,the alchemist dismounted slowly and the boy did the same
./data/Client3\sample-002408.mp3,some of those who saw its flight say it travelled with a hissing sound
./data/Client3\sample-002409.mp3,he had understood the story the old king had told him
./data/Client3\sample-002410.mp3,they're just a pile of stones
./data/Client3\sample-002411.mp3,i'll stop him cold
./data/Client3\sample-002412.mp3,it helped me to trust in people the englishman answered
./data/Client3\sample-002413.mp3,as soon as he saw me among the crowd he called to me to come down
./data/Client3\sample-002414.mp3,you don't have to be rich skinny popular or even own a cape to perform a random act of kindness
./data/Client3\sample-002415.mp3,who did you talk to
./data/Client3\sample-002416.mp3,my wife pointed out to me the brightness of the red green and yellow signal lights
./data/Client3\sample-002417.mp3,have liv call me in the restaurant in twenty minutes
./data/Client3\sample-002418.mp3,it spread through the planet's atmosphere and obscured its more familiar features
./data/Client3\sample-002419.mp3,what are they wearing now
./data/Client3\sample-002420.mp3,strange images passed through my mind
./data/Client3\sample-002421.mp3,there was no empathy for her now
./data/Client3\sample-002422.mp3,i locked eyes with a fish in the tank
./data/Client3\sample-002423.mp3,the animals were exhausted and the men talked among themselves less and less
./data/Client3\sample-002424.mp3,to do that successfully i must have no fear of failure
./data/Client3\sample-002425.mp3,so he could not be hasty nor impatient
./data/Client3\sample-002426.mp3,this recording is corrupted
./data/Client3\sample-002427.mp3,enough said the boy
./data/Client3\sample-002428.mp3,all they think about is food and water
./data/Client3\sample-002429.mp3,the train lines provided an easy path to follow
./data/Client3\sample-002430.mp3,i need to sell some wool the boy told the merchant
./data/Client3\sample-002431.mp3,it'll do you no good
./data/Client3\sample-002432.mp3,it was only when i got this close to it that the strangeness of it was at all evident to me
./data/Client3\sample-002433.mp3,at the first glance it was really not very exciting
./data/Client3\sample-002434.mp3,where's ashley's wallet
./data/Client3\sample-002435.mp3,i want to get something out of it
./data/Client3\sample-002436.mp3,would you like to see where i was tattooed
./data/Client3\sample-002437.mp3,please don't make me
./data/Client3\sample-002438.mp3,then it was the radio
./data/Client3\sample-002439.mp3,and look how many things the wind already knew how to do
./data/Client3\sample-002440.mp3,they say at patti's house he left two hours ago
./data/Client3\sample-002441.mp3,i'm going to them
./data/Client3\sample-002442.mp3,you can't believe it's not butter
./data/Client3\sample-002443.mp3,the thing itself was almost entirely buried in sand
./data/Client3\sample-002444.mp3,i was wondering if you could tell me a bit more about what it's like to live and work there
./data/Client3\sample-002445.mp3,that couldn't be one of the matthew boys
./data/Client3\sample-002446.mp3,i shall make us some ice cubes
./data/Client3\sample-002447.mp3,without a single quiver
./data/Client3\sample-002448.mp3,the boy was surprised
./data/Client3\sample-002449.mp3,the thing itself was almost entirely buried in sand
./data/Client3\sample-002450.mp3,it was a strange furnace fueled by firewood with a transparent flask heating on top
./data/Client3\sample-002451.mp3,overall i'm happy with the new device enough that i ordered one for both home and work
./data/Client3\sample-002452.mp3,i'm not going very far the alchemist answered looking straight into the eyes of the horsemen
./data/Client3\sample-002453.mp3,i don't want to change anything because i don't know how to deal with change
./data/Client3\sample-002454.mp3,the sunset faded into twilight before anything else happened
./data/Client3\sample-002455.mp3,i thought she was dead
./data/Client3\sample-002456.mp3,i was disappointed at this inanimate bulk
./data/Client3\sample-002457.mp3,he was immensely excited at the news
./data/Client3\sample-002458.mp3,he was going to miss the place and all the good things he had learned
./data/Client3\sample-002459.mp3,in his hand he grasped a snake by the tail
./data/Client3\sample-002460.mp3,i'm the stranger around here
./data/Client3\sample-002461.mp3,you can't go any farther one of them said
./data/Client3\sample-002462.mp3,spotted dick is a classic british pudding
./data/Client3\sample-002463.mp3,well then why did you let me do it the boy asked
./data/Client3\sample-002464.mp3,you should see the other guy specifically how good at fighting he is
./data/Client3\sample-002465.mp3,why don't you want me to see him
./data/Client3\sample-002466.mp3,the cup handle has broken
./data/Client3\sample-002467.mp3,but then he stopped
./data/Client3\sample-002468.mp3,we don't know when the war will end so we can't continue our journey he said
./data/Client3\sample-002469.mp3,there were really i think two or three hundred people elbowing one another
./data/Client3\sample-002470.mp3,don't say anything fatima interrupted
./data/Client3\sample-002471.mp3,but i didnt think that it contained any living creature
./data/Client3\sample-002472.mp3,'m all about those invisible cosmic connections that transcend time and distance
./data/Client3\sample-002473.mp3,there was very little talking
./data/Client3\sample-002474.mp3,one of these days is tomorrow
./data/Client3\sample-002475.mp3,the boy mumbled an answer that allowed him to avoid responding to her question
./data/Client3\sample-002476.mp3,his adversary had three respawns remaining
./data/Client3\sample-002477.mp3,the lightyear is a unit of distance not of time
./data/Client3\sample-002478.mp3,i've had this shop for thirty years
./data/Client3\sample-002479.mp3,the thought was so dreadful to him that he forgot about the heat and went forward
./data/Client3\sample-002480.mp3,the top had certainly ceased to rotate
./data/Client3\sample-002481.mp3,some went away while i was there and other people came
./data/Client3\sample-002482.mp3,the miner had abandoned everything to go mining for emeralds
./data/Client3\sample-002483.mp3,the next day the boy returned to the well hoping to see the girl
./data/Client3\sample-002484.mp3,the nearby city of ceuta had grown faster than tangier and business had fallen off
./data/Client3\sample-002485.mp3,i was impatient to see it opened
./data/Client3\sample-002486.mp3,there was a small building there with a window at which people bought tickets to africa
./data/Client3\sample-002487.mp3,you don't have to be rich skinny popular or even own a cape to perform a random act of kindness
./data/Client3\sample-002488.mp3,but my heart is agitated the boy said
./data/Client3\sample-002489.mp3,first he had studied esperanto then the world's religions and now it was alchemy
./data/Client3\sample-002490.mp3,you don't happen to have eight thousand bucks on you
./data/Client3\sample-002491.mp3,i locked eyes with a fish in the tank
./data/Client3\sample-002492.mp3,everyone is just standing by the building waiting to get in
./data/Client3\sample-002493.mp3,the merchant turned to a customer who wanted three crystal glasses
./data/Client3\sample-002494.mp3,i wished i had a light to smoke by
./data/Client3\sample-002495.mp3,turning off gadgets that are not in use can save a lot of energy
./data/Client3\sample-002496.mp3,it was as if the world had fallen silent because the boy's soul had
./data/Client3\sample-002497.mp3,the two walked out among the palms
./data/Client3\sample-002498.mp3,there was a small building there with a window at which people bought tickets to africa
./data/Client3\sample-002499.mp3,it picks up on the mike
./data/Client3\sample-002500.mp3,but he decided first to buy his bakery and put some money aside
./data/Client3\sample-002501.mp3,if he hasn't he certainly has a telephone book
./data/Client3\sample-002502.mp3,some of the presented conclusions are not supported by the reported results
./data/Client3\sample-002503.mp3,see if we can move it
./data/Client3\sample-002504.mp3,it was a useful reminder to complete the task
./data/Client3\sample-002505.mp3,bert the cop was wounded in north africa
./data/Client3\sample-002506.mp3,they looked for the fallen mass but found nothing
./data/Client3\sample-002507.mp3,my name is melchizedek said the old man
./data/Client3\sample-002508.mp3,will you give me your blessing asked the boy
./data/Client3\sample-002509.mp3,the italian got her words mixed up
./data/Client3\sample-002510.mp3,some of the grey ash was falling off the circular edge
./data/Client3\sample-002511.mp3,my wife pointed out to me the brightness of the red green and yellow signal lights
./data/Client3\sample-002512.mp3,their faces were covered with the blue cloths and their eyes showed fear
./data/Client3\sample-002513.mp3,i left my father my mother and the town castle behind
./data/Client3\sample-002514.mp3,where do you live
./data/Client3\sample-002515.mp3,for that price you might as well get the brand name cordless drill
./data/Client3\sample-002516.mp3,the alchemist followed as the boy's horse ran for almost half an hour
./data/Client3\sample-002517.mp3,it's too bad that he's quickly going to forget my name he thought
./data/Client3\sample-002518.mp3,another dreamer said the ticket seller to his assistant watching the boy walk away
./data/Client3\sample-002519.mp3,the two men exchanged some words in arabic and the bar owner seemed irritated
./data/Client3\sample-002520.mp3,now i will drift gently off to dreamland
./data/Client3\sample-002521.mp3,i got doctor bills to pay
./data/Client3\sample-002522.mp3,the monk laughed when he saw me come back in tatters
./data/Client3\sample-002523.mp3,maybe no one here knows what an alchemist is
./data/Client3\sample-002524.mp3,hundreds of observers saw the flame that night and the night after
./data/Client3\sample-002525.mp3,if you tell me why you came here i'll show you the project i've been working on
./data/Client3\sample-002526.mp3,i think we can do better after the boat sails
./data/Client3\sample-002527.mp3,it's the master work of the alchemists
./data/Client3\sample-002528.mp3,they called that discovery the master work  it was part liquid and part solid
./data/Client3\sample-002529.mp3,i had a dream and i met with a king
./data/Client3\sample-002530.mp3,his life and his path had always provided him with enough omens
./data/Client3\sample-002531.mp3,he must know how to deal with the snakes of the desert
./data/Client3\sample-002532.mp3,i can learn something from the desert too
./data/Client3\sample-002533.mp3,my review of the sun one star
./data/Client3\sample-002534.mp3,it doesnt count as screen time if it is a game
./data/Client3\sample-002535.mp3,the ferry line is too long to consider taking it
./data/Client3\sample-002536.mp3,the boy swore that every time he heard the alarm he would heed its message
./data/Client3\sample-002537.mp3,my seven year resume gap is marked not drugs
./data/Client3\sample-002538.mp3,there is only one way to learn the alchemist answered
./data/Client3\sample-002539.mp3,of course the two were unable to do anything
./data/Client3\sample-002540.mp3,it has happened many times before
./data/Client3\sample-002541.mp3,what about higgins against becca
./data/Client3\sample-002542.mp3,that sobered him a little
./data/Client3\sample-002543.mp3,trying to improve the world by jumping up and down
./data/Client3\sample-002544.mp3,he had no idea how he was going to transform himself into the wind
./data/Client3\sample-002545.mp3,i was disappointed at this inanimate bulk
./data/Client3\sample-002546.mp3,the driver got knocked cold
./data/Client3\sample-002547.mp3,but now the sounds inside had stopped
./data/Client3\sample-002548.mp3,it was such a gradual movement that he found it only by noticing the dots
./data/Client3\sample-002549.mp3,her records were incomplete
./data/Client3\sample-002550.mp3,i have the diet of a kid who found twenty dollars
./data/Client3\sample-002551.mp3,the young arab took out a book and began to read
./data/Client3\sample-002552.mp3,but the boy was certain that he had been looking at them
./data/Client3\sample-002553.mp3,they become a part of everything
./data/Client3\sample-002554.mp3,sun is better than rain
./data/Client3\sample-002555.mp3,the thing itself was almost entirely buried in sand
./data/Client3\sample-002556.mp3,so now i'm a camel driver
./data/Client3\sample-002557.mp3,my puberty was probably taxing for mommy and daddy
./data/Client3\sample-002558.mp3,many of our soldiers teamed up
./data/Client3\sample-002559.mp3,it spread through the planet's atmosphere and obscured its more familiar features
./data/Client3\sample-002560.mp3,the boy leapt as well but away from the alchemist
./data/Client3\sample-002561.mp3,the greatest authority on meteorites stated that the height of its first appearance was about ninety or one hundred miles
./data/Client3\sample-002562.mp3,none of this ha d made an impression on the boy
./data/Client3\sample-002563.mp3,they must be used to their new shepherd and have probably already forgotten me
./data/Client3\sample-002564.mp3,i can clean up those glasses in the window if you want said the boy
./data/Client3\sample-002565.mp3,i've had this shop for thirty years
./data/Client3\sample-002566.mp3,now i can see that it hasn't been too bad
./data/Client3\sample-002567.mp3,when he saw henderson in his garden he called over the fence and made himself understood
./data/Client3\sample-002568.mp3,this jelly doesn't taste of limes
./data/Client3\sample-002569.mp3,they were both silent for a time observing the plaza and the townspeople
./data/Client3\sample-002570.mp3,there were mountains in the distance
./data/Client3\sample-002571.mp3,the insurance was sky high
./data/Client3\sample-002572.mp3,ogilvy watched till one and then gave up
./data/Client3\sample-002573.mp3,i was disappointed at this inanimate bulk
./data/Client3\sample-002574.mp3,suddenly one of the hawks made a flashing dive through the sky attacking the other
./data/Client3\sample-002575.mp3,he must know how to deal with the snakes of the desert
./data/Client3\sample-002576.mp3,the top of the cylinder was rotating on its body
./data/Client3\sample-002577.mp3,i want you to help me turn myself into the wind the boy answered
./data/Client3\sample-002578.mp3,yeah its definitely worth checking out especially if the pay is reasonable and the work is good for your career there was absolutely no reason for her to announce it to the entire company
./data/Client3\sample-002579.mp3,it was the old man who spoke first
./data/Client3\sample-002580.mp3,it spread through the planet's atmosphere and obscured its more familiar features
./data/Client3\sample-002581.mp3,i'd like to join but nobody asked me
./data/Client3\sample-002582.mp3,the night was warm and i was thirsty
./data/Client3\sample-002583.mp3,what do you need
./data/Client3\sample-002584.mp3,they rented a boat and went down the river
./data/Client3\sample-002585.mp3,some of the grey ash was falling off the circular edge
./data/Client3\sample-002586.mp3,a monk dressed in black came to the gates
./data/Client3\sample-002587.mp3,many people in berkshire surrey and middlesex must have seen it
./data/Client3\sample-002588.mp3,until then he had considered the omens to be things of this world
./data/Client3\sample-002589.mp3,you shouldn't be here the alchemist answered
./data/Client3\sample-002590.mp3,he knew all the fields and pastures of andalusia
./data/Client3\sample-002591.mp3,some do come back
./data/Client3\sample-002592.mp3,it was dropping off in flakes and raining down on the sand
./data/Client3\sample-002593.mp3,i saw neil yesterday afternoon
./data/Client3\sample-002594.mp3,you must not let up even after having come so far he continued
./data/Client3\sample-002595.mp3,hundreds must have seen it and taken it for a falling star
./data/Client3\sample-002596.mp3,coming home a party of tourists passed us singing and playing music
./data/Client3\sample-002597.mp3,something terrible's happened to me
./data/Client3\sample-002598.mp3,i'd like to build a display case for the crystal the boy said to the merchant
./data/Client3\sample-002599.mp3,i heard a faint movement under my feet
./data/Client3\sample-002600.mp3,you came so that you could learn about your dreams said the old woman
./data/Client3\sample-002601.mp3,there was no way for everybody to know about alchemy
./data/Client3\sample-002602.mp3,this is for the boy
./data/Client3\sample-002603.mp3,nothing's going to happen
./data/Client3\sample-002604.mp3,he took his plate grabbed a knife and fork and scowled at the savagery on television
./data/Client3\sample-002605.mp3,many people in berkshire surrey and middlesex must have seen it
./data/Client3\sample-002606.mp3,in a little while
./data/Client3\sample-002607.mp3,the runway seems way to short for this type of plane
./data/Client3\sample-002608.mp3,as soon as he saw me among the crowd he called to me to come down
./data/Client3\sample-002609.mp3,by tomorrow they'll be calling me bruce baldwin
./data/Client3\sample-002610.mp3,i'm going to guide you across the desert the alchemist said
./data/Client3\sample-002611.mp3,we've got to do something
./data/Client3\sample-002612.mp3,it was no more exciting than an overturned carriage or a tree blown across the road
./data/Client3\sample-002613.mp3,i still have no idea how to turn myself into the wind the boy repeated
./data/Client3\sample-002614.mp3,he lost a lot of money through gambling in the casino
./data/Client3\sample-002615.mp3,but now the sounds inside had stopped
./data/Client3\sample-002616.mp3,it was seen early in the morning rushing over eastward
./data/Client3\sample-002617.mp3,and then he perceived it very slowly
./data/Client3\sample-002618.mp3,the alchemist was a bit daunting but as the boy drank the wine he relaxed
./data/Client3\sample-002619.mp3,the merchant was silent for a few moments
./data/Client3\sample-002620.mp3,children jumping in puddles
./data/Client3\sample-002621.mp3,but you are forcing me to look at wealth and at horizons i have never known
./data/Client3\sample-002622.mp3,the experience in the coffin was literally immersive
./data/Client3\sample-002623.mp3,where do you come in
./data/Client3\sample-002624.mp3,but horses tire bit by bit
./data/Client3\sample-002625.mp3,i'm going home and see my wife and family
./data/Client3\sample-002626.mp3,i was just asking
./data/Client3\sample-002627.mp3,a steel framed table separated one half of the room from the other
./data/Client3\sample-002628.mp3,about how wealthy would you say
./data/Client3\sample-002629.mp3,the snake fought frantically making hissing sounds that shattered the silence of the desert
./data/Client3\sample-002630.mp3,he slipped on the stairs
./data/Client3\sample-002631.mp3,finally a young woman approached who was not dressed in black
./data/Client3\sample-002632.mp3,he noticed the unequal cooling of its surface
./data/Client3\sample-002633.mp3,the sunset faded into twilight before anything else happened
./data/Client3\sample-002634.mp3,but they were not there
./data/Client3\sample-002635.mp3,the level ground was blackened as far as one could see and it was still giving off smoke
./data/Client3\sample-002636.mp3,they formed heaps that are visible a mile and a half away
./data/Client3\sample-002637.mp3,the boy fell to his knees and wept
./data/Client3\sample-002638.mp3,what do you need
./data/Client3\sample-002639.mp3,i shall make us some ice cubes
./data/Client3\sample-002640.mp3,he needs three days answered the alchemist
./data/Client3\sample-002641.mp3,they seemed to laugh at him and he laughed back his heart bursting with joy
./data/Client3\sample-002642.mp3,the agent secretly entered the embassy from the roof
./data/Client3\sample-002643.mp3,please use normal slashes not backslashes
./data/Client3\sample-002644.mp3,michael opened a browser and navigated to an anonymous search engine
./data/Client3\sample-002645.mp3,the strange horseman drew an enormous curved sword from a scabbard mounted on his saddle
./data/Client3\sample-002646.mp3,i'm not going very far the alchemist answered looking straight into the eyes of the horsemen
./data/Client3\sample-002647.mp3,you don't have to be rich skinny popular or even own a cape to perform a random act of kindness
./data/Client3\sample-002648.mp3,in some places the ground was covered with the salt of driedup lakes
./data/Client3\sample-002649.mp3,i have already found my treasure
./data/Client3\sample-002650.mp3,it was immediately apparent
./data/Client3\sample-002651.mp3,we'll carry the desk over
./data/Client3\sample-002652.mp3,and he wasn't faring much better
./data/Client3\sample-002653.mp3,there's a bunch of autograph seekers out front
./data/Client3\sample-002654.mp3,absolutely despicable that gingerbread men are forced to live in houses made of their own flesh
./data/Client3\sample-002655.mp3,by tomorrow they'll be calling me bruce baldwin
./data/Client3\sample-002656.mp3,but only speak a word and my servant will be healed
./data/Client3\sample-002657.mp3,now look what you did
./data/Client3\sample-002658.mp3,looking through the telescope i saw a circle of deep blue and the little round planet
./data/Client3\sample-002659.mp3,you knew the whole story
./data/Client3\sample-002660.mp3,he didn't consider mending the hole  the stones could fall through any time they wanted
./data/Client3\sample-002661.mp3,why do they make things so complicated he asked the englishman one night
./data/Client3\sample-002662.mp3,all that time the martians must have been getting ready
./data/Client3\sample-002663.mp3,there were mountains in the distance
./data/Client3\sample-002664.mp3,so he asked if the old man's blessing was still with him
./data/Client3\sample-002665.mp3,from the railway station in the distance came the sound of trains ringing and rumbling
./data/Client3\sample-002666.mp3,i was scared but wasted no time in going out and crossing the bridge to the sand pits
./data/Client3\sample-002667.mp3,the apples are in the basket near the door on your way out
./data/Client3\sample-002668.mp3,it was a useful reminder to complete the task
./data/Client3\sample-002669.mp3,if someone isn't what others want them to be the others become angry
./data/Client3\sample-002670.mp3,just tell them marge sent you
./data/Client3\sample-002671.mp3,three armed tribesmen approached and asked what the boy and the alchemist were doing there
./data/Client3\sample-002672.mp3,i've been to your house a hundred times
./data/Client3\sample-002673.mp3,replace the ts in tim tebow's name with any other consonant to get a star wars character
./data/Client3\sample-002674.mp3,the crowd swayed a little as i elbowed my way through
./data/Client3\sample-002675.mp3,the first day passed
./data/Client3\sample-002676.mp3,just handling them made him feel better
./data/Client3\sample-002677.mp3,because life wants you to achieve your destiny
./data/Client3\sample-002678.mp3,then he dropped his spade picked up his jacket and came out into the road
./data/Client3\sample-002679.mp3,he wanted to tell him about fatima
./data/Client3\sample-002680.mp3,i wish you wouldn't
./data/Client3\sample-002681.mp3,the boy thought it a strange question
./data/Client3\sample-002682.mp3,ogilvy watched till one and then gave up
./data/Client3\sample-002683.mp3,you can't believe it's not butter
./data/Client3\sample-002684.mp3,the boy promised himself that when he returned from egypt he would buy that sword
./data/Client3\sample-002685.mp3,she likes you
./data/Client3\sample-002686.mp3,he paid for the wool and asked the shepherd to come back the following year
./data/Client3\sample-002687.mp3,i'll talk to you tonight
./data/Client3\sample-002688.mp3,maybe that's why they always stay close to me
./data/Client3\sample-002689.mp3,looking around he sought his sheep and then realized that he was in a new world
./data/Client3\sample-002690.mp3,especially with an election coming up in a few days
./data/Client3\sample-002691.mp3,everyone should have health insurance
./data/Client3\sample-002692.mp3,they tell their incredible stories at the time when you want to hear them
./data/Client3\sample-002693.mp3,no one paid any attention to the two travelers
./data/Client3\sample-002694.mp3,if you know your heart well it will never be able to do that to you
./data/Client3\sample-002695.mp3,i am following my destiny
./data/Client3\sample-002696.mp3,i own my own house
./data/Client3\sample-002697.mp3,then how do i know this is your office
./data/Client3\sample-002698.mp3,we know what you're up to
./data/Client3\sample-002699.mp3,it was no more exciting than an overturned carriage or a tree blown across the road
./data/Client3\sample-002700.mp3,bacon pancakes and maple syrup is a hearty start to any day
./data/Client3\sample-002701.mp3,the men were terrified at his sorcery
./data/Client3\sample-002702.mp3,i'm beginning to think women make the best spies
./data/Client3\sample-002703.mp3,yet each felt his heart beat a bit faster
./data/Client3\sample-002704.mp3,but the crystal merchant had no choice
./data/Client3\sample-002705.mp3,he listened to the wind and felt the stones beneath his feet
./data/Client3\sample-002706.mp3,you will never be able to escape from your heart
./data/Client3\sample-002707.mp3,her jeans have holes in them
./data/Client3\sample-002708.mp3,it seemed to him that it fell to earth about one hundred miles east of here
./data/Client3\sample-002709.mp3,now it will be with hope
./data/Client3\sample-002710.mp3,i knows i'm a luxury
./data/Client3\sample-002711.mp3,they might even have become friends but the englishman closed off the conversation
./data/Client3\sample-002712.mp3,with the wars between the tribes it's impossible to cross the desert
./data/Client3\sample-002713.mp3,the genies were the spirits of good and evil
./data/Client3\sample-002714.mp3,henderson was taking it in
./data/Client3\sample-002715.mp3,you and i aren't like hassan that rich merchant
./data/Client3\sample-002716.mp3,he thought about asking him to give it back but decided that would be unfriendly
./data/Client3\sample-002717.mp3,one must prepare for it
./data/Client3\sample-002718.mp3,what do you do when you work
./data/Client3\sample-002719.mp3,i'm going to go back to doing just what i did before the boy thought
./data/Client3\sample-002720.mp3,i don't know if i'll be able to find life in the desert the boy thought
./data/Client3\sample-002721.mp3,that's what i'm afraid of
./data/Client3\sample-002722.mp3,the boy was shocked
./data/Client3\sample-002723.mp3,what had been next to him five minutes ago was now at the other side
./data/Client3\sample-002724.mp3,well he thought about that the old man said
./data/Client3\sample-002725.mp3,hundreds of observers saw the flame that night and the night after
./data/Client3\sample-002726.mp3,that'll close my account
./data/Client3\sample-002727.mp3,have liv call me in the restaurant in twenty minutes
./data/Client3\sample-002728.mp3,he did find it soon after dawn and not far from the sand pits
./data/Client3\sample-002729.mp3,i remember how i sat on the table there in the blackness with patches of green and crimson swimming before my eyes
./data/Client3\sample-002730.mp3,was the doctor here
./data/Client3\sample-002731.mp3,that's never happened to me the boy said
./data/Client3\sample-002732.mp3,the end of the cylinder was still as ogilvy and henderson had left it
./data/Client3\sample-002733.mp3,maybe this is an omen said the englishman half aloud
./data/Client3\sample-002734.mp3,i'd like to change places with you for just one day
./data/Client3\sample-002735.mp3,remember the interview i wrote with alice wellman
./data/Client3\sample-002736.mp3,they reminded him of the old man
./data/Client3\sample-002737.mp3,and he wasn't faring much better
./data/Client3\sample-002738.mp3,much better said the old man
./data/Client3\sample-002739.mp3,they mounted their horses
./data/Client3\sample-002740.mp3,some of those who saw its flight say it travelled with a hissing sound
./data/Client3\sample-002741.mp3,i had seen all that it would presently bring me
./data/Client3\sample-002742.mp3,the desert was all sand in some stretches and rocky in others
./data/Client3\sample-002743.mp3,they were given to me as a present by a king the boy said
./data/Client3\sample-002744.mp3,don't they believe in angels
./data/Client3\sample-002745.mp3,i have the diet of a kid who found twenty dollars
./data/Client3\sample-002746.mp3,the alchemist was a bit daunting but as the boy drank the wine he relaxed
./data/Client3\sample-002747.mp3,don't you want me to stay
./data/Client3\sample-002748.mp3,that radiator is emitting an uncomfortable amount of heat
./data/Client3\sample-002749.mp3,symbols of the little people
./data/Client3\sample-002750.mp3,albert didn't have a brother
./data/Client3\sample-002751.mp3,not until the moon was high did the alchemist ride into view
./data/Client3\sample-002752.mp3,the angel touched the man's shoulder and they were both projected far into the future
./data/Client3\sample-002753.mp3,have you got a ring
./data/Client3\sample-002754.mp3,yes or even search for treasure
./data/Client3\sample-002755.mp3,the sunset faded into twilight before anything else happened
./data/Client3\sample-002756.mp3,i've got the party here
./data/Client3\sample-002757.mp3,we got orders to hold you safely in the branches of this pine tree
./data/Client3\sample-002758.mp3,have you notified the police
./data/Client3\sample-002759.mp3,but arms cannot be drawn unless they also go into battle
./data/Client3\sample-002760.mp3,we've been laughing all day about that
./data/Client3\sample-002761.mp3,the boy continued to listen to his heart as they crossed the desert
./data/Client3\sample-002762.mp3,jim thinks it's morgan
./data/Client3\sample-002763.mp3,i need to sell some wool the boy told the merchant
./data/Client3\sample-002764.mp3,the streamer of gas came out towards us
./data/Client3\sample-002765.mp3,but the crystal merchant had no choice
./data/Client3\sample-002766.mp3,it was starlight and i explained the signs of the zodiac to her
./data/Client3\sample-002767.mp3,i would have won the junior olympics if not for those medaling kids
./data/Client3\sample-002768.mp3,i don't want to rush you
./data/Client3\sample-002769.mp3,your money saved us for three days
./data/Client3\sample-002770.mp3,proteins have many functions in the human body
./data/Client3\sample-002771.mp3,too many concessions have been made
./data/Client3\sample-002772.mp3,not to worry said the alchemist
./data/Client3\sample-002773.mp3,had our instruments permitted it we might have been able to see the trouble way back when
./data/Client3\sample-002774.mp3,he decided to boycott games with digital restriction management in the future
./data/Client3\sample-002775.mp3,elsa knitted furiously
./data/Client3\sample-002776.mp3,he knew how to shear them and how to slaughter them
./data/Client3\sample-002777.mp3,my friend bought all the other sheep immediately
./data/Client3\sample-002778.mp3,but i didnt think that it contained any living creature
./data/Client3\sample-002779.mp3,ogilvy watched till one and then gave up
./data/Client3\sample-002780.mp3,because the crystal was dirty
./data/Client3\sample-002781.mp3,but i'm going to egypt the boy said
./data/Client3\sample-002782.mp3,what are they doing the old man asked pointing at the people in the plaza
./data/Client3\sample-002783.mp3,he's out duckshooting now
./data/Client3\sample-002784.mp3,everything you need to know you have learned through your journey
./data/Client3\sample-002785.mp3,but just before lunchtime a boy stopped in front of the shop
./data/Client3\sample-002786.mp3,you guys wanna play some more poker
./data/Client3\sample-002787.mp3,then i suggest you call one of them
./data/Client3\sample-002788.mp3,i should have repeated it for him
./data/Client3\sample-002789.mp3,i wired her that i wasn't coming
./data/Client3\sample-002790.mp3,he approached the mass and was surprised at the size and the shape
./data/Client3\sample-002791.mp3,the boy laughed  out of happiness
./data/Client3\sample-002792.mp3,it seemed to him that it fell to earth about one hundred miles east of here
./data/Client3\sample-002793.mp3,don't let them see that you're afraid the alchemist said
./data/Client3\sample-002794.mp3,the time must have been somewhere around six o'clock
./data/Client3\sample-002795.mp3,the alchemist knocked on the gate of the monastery
./data/Client3\sample-002796.mp3,get a tray for these great big important leaders
./data/Client3\sample-002797.mp3,walking along in the silence he had no regrets
./data/Client3\sample-002798.mp3,it was a bundle of money
./data/Client3\sample-002799.mp3,they walked together through the narrow streets of tangier
./data/Client3\sample-002800.mp3,the boy thanked him ate it and went on his way
./data/Client3\sample-002801.mp3,do you know that i threw it away
./data/Client3\sample-002802.mp3,his life and his path had always provided him with enough omens
./data/Client3\sample-002803.mp3,i guess you must think i'm kinda batty
./data/Client3\sample-002804.mp3,i got drunk yesterday and thought i built a super computer
./data/Client3\sample-002805.mp3,worked hard just to have food and water like the sheep
./data/Client3\sample-002806.mp3,in one he had read that many years ago a famous arabian alchemist had visited europe
./data/Client3\sample-002807.mp3,i need you to be spontaneous he asked me out to din din
./data/Client3\sample-002808.mp3,they were in an immense setting surrounded by thousands of people speaking a strange language
./data/Client3\sample-002809.mp3,where was his horse
./data/Client3\sample-002810.mp3,what does that get us
./data/Client3\sample-002811.mp3,you're playing with dynamite
./data/Client3\sample-002812.mp3,when he speaks in our language i can interpret what he has said
./data/Client3\sample-002813.mp3,we're going to shoot the works
./data/Client3\sample-002814.mp3,upon returning to the wise man he related in detail everything he had seen
./data/Client3\sample-002815.mp3,can i get a woot woot
./data/Client3\sample-002816.mp3,please bring mama back
./data/Client3\sample-002817.mp3,i can only tell you what i saw
./data/Client3\sample-002818.mp3,the city was still sleeping
./data/Client3\sample-002819.mp3,i pointed out mars a bright dot of light
./data/Client3\sample-002820.mp3,i second mr potter's motion
./data/Client3\sample-002821.mp3,and above all don't forget to follow your destiny through to its conclusion
./data/Client3\sample-002822.mp3,i saw astonishment and horror on the faces of the people around me
./data/Client3\sample-002823.mp3,it was starlight and i explained the signs of the zodiac to her
./data/Client3\sample-002824.mp3,that's all i ask
./data/Client3\sample-002825.mp3,don't forget that everything you deal with is only one thing and nothing else
./data/Client3\sample-002826.mp3,take your paws off me
./data/Client3\sample-002827.mp3,what good is money to you if you're going to die
./data/Client3\sample-002828.mp3,maybe we'd better ask someone the boy suggested
./data/Client3\sample-002829.mp3,can i get a woot woot
./data/Client3\sample-002830.mp3,the view had better be worth it
./data/Client3\sample-002831.mp3,i'm getting married tomorrow
./data/Client3\sample-002832.mp3,certainly i'm sure i'm comfortable
./data/Client3\sample-002833.mp3,monday morning at five o'clock
./data/Client3\sample-002834.mp3,a thin circle of bright metal showed between the top and the body of the cylinder
./data/Client3\sample-002835.mp3,what makes you think they're even interested
./data/Client3\sample-002836.mp3,it was bunched up and he had hardly thought of it for a long time
./data/Client3\sample-002837.mp3,but she hadn't charged him anything
./data/Client3\sample-002838.mp3,not until the moon was high did the alchemist ride into view
./data/Client3\sample-002839.mp3,he wasn't asking for help
./data/Client3\sample-002840.mp3,then a man approached
./data/Client3\sample-002841.mp3,it's coming right over
./data/Client3\sample-002842.mp3,the alchemist's words echoed out like a curse
./data/Client3\sample-002843.mp3,there was a moment of silence so profound that it seemed the city was asleep
./data/Client3\sample-002844.mp3,the tribal chieftains will appreciate what you do
./data/Client3\sample-002845.mp3,the merry christmas wreath for the window
./data/Client3\sample-002846.mp3,can't you read me
./data/Client3\sample-002847.mp3,i don't know how to turn them into reality
./data/Client3\sample-002848.mp3,says for us to go the limit
./data/Client3\sample-002849.mp3,do geese always fly in that formation
./data/Client3\sample-002850.mp3,the list was frighteningly extensive
./data/Client3\sample-002851.mp3,i found a little crowd of about twenty people surrounding the huge hole
./data/Client3\sample-002852.mp3,the jacket had a purpose and so did the boy
./data/Client3\sample-002853.mp3,and a million and one other things
./data/Client3\sample-002854.mp3,was it my fault
./data/Client3\sample-002855.mp3,the caravan began to travel day and night
./data/Client3\sample-002856.mp3,this website needs more interactive elements
./data/Client3\sample-002857.mp3,before the boy could reply a butterfly appeared and fluttered between him and the old man
./data/Client3\sample-002858.mp3,i'm not going very far the alchemist answered looking straight into the eyes of the horsemen
./data/Client3\sample-002859.mp3,i didn't mean to shoot him
./data/Client3\sample-002860.mp3,hires two personal trainers and make one of them train the other one
./data/Client3\sample-002861.mp3,but you know that i'm not going to go to mecca
./data/Client3\sample-002862.mp3,why the shots stopped after the tenth no one on earth has tried to explain
./data/Client3\sample-002863.mp3,men have never understood the words of the wise
./data/Client3\sample-002864.mp3,he washed the detritus from his hair
./data/Client3\sample-002865.mp3,but i found it difficult to get to work because of the investigations
./data/Client3\sample-002866.mp3,the boy went to look for the englishman
./data/Client3\sample-002867.mp3,there was a loud shriek from a woman standing behind us
./data/Client3\sample-002868.mp3,the alchemist probably already knew all that
./data/Client3\sample-002869.mp3,what's that book you've got there
./data/Client3\sample-002870.mp3,can i get a woot woot
./data/Client3\sample-002871.mp3,you're my daughter and i love you
./data/Client3\sample-002872.mp3,the hand with the whip pointed to the south
./data/Client3\sample-002873.mp3,no one seemed to have thought about it that night
./data/Client3\sample-002874.mp3,i'm proud of you
./data/Client3\sample-002875.mp3,trust in your heart but never forget that you're in the desert
./data/Client3\sample-002876.mp3,now go upstairs and see what little christina wants
./data/Client3\sample-002877.mp3,its time to save the internet  again
./data/Client3\sample-002878.mp3,the old man leafed through the book and fell to reading a page he came to
./data/Client3\sample-002879.mp3,yes or even search for treasure
./data/Client3\sample-002880.mp3,the first day passed
./data/Client3\sample-002881.mp3,so how will we name all these hurricanes
./data/Client3\sample-002882.mp3,i wish they were too
./data/Client3\sample-002883.mp3,he stood irresolute for a moment and then scrambled out of the pit
./data/Client3\sample-002884.mp3,i want to see him do it said the chief
./data/Client3\sample-002885.mp3,this morning i found a calculator taped to my wii
./data/Client3\sample-002886.mp3,is he really supposed to read that many books on philosophy
./data/Client3\sample-002887.mp3,i'm afraid it is important
./data/Client3\sample-002888.mp3,you'll get your money in sixty days
./data/Client3\sample-002889.mp3,you have no idea what's happened to me
./data/Client3\sample-002890.mp3,if that guy lays an egg
./data/Client3\sample-002891.mp3,one can imagine these two covered with sand running up the little street in the bright sunlight
./data/Client3\sample-002892.mp3,it'll do you no good
./data/Client3\sample-002893.mp3,the hand with the whip pointed to the south
./data/Client3\sample-002894.mp3,he picked up the two stones and put them back in his pouch
./data/Client3\sample-002895.mp3,the boy spent a sleepless night
./data/Client3\sample-002896.mp3,there were just drawings coded instructions and obscure texts
./data/Client3\sample-002897.mp3,it was bunched up and he had hardly thought of it for a long time
./data/Client3\sample-002898.mp3,it was the time of day when all of spain slept during the summer
./data/Client3\sample-002899.mp3,it's too bad that he's quickly going to forget my name he thought
./data/Client3\sample-002900.mp3,your son went to serve at a distant place and became a centurion
./data/Client3\sample-002901.mp3,the problem is that they don't even realize that they're walking a new road every day
./data/Client3\sample-002902.mp3,that first day everyone slept from exhaustion including the englishman
./data/Client3\sample-002903.mp3,mother's on the extension
./data/Client3\sample-002904.mp3,what are you doing on this fine day
./data/Client3\sample-002905.mp3,men have never understood the words of the wise
./data/Client3\sample-002906.mp3,more good luck telegrams
./data/Client3\sample-002907.mp3,did you say a king he asked
./data/Client3\sample-002908.mp3,i felt like bruce wayne building his batcave
./data/Client3\sample-002909.mp3,he's the man the ads are written for
./data/Client3\sample-002910.mp3,my tax dollars pay for those public school proms
./data/Client3\sample-002911.mp3,and the sand and gravel had been flung violently in every direction
./data/Client3\sample-002912.mp3,come on in the office here
./data/Client3\sample-002913.mp3,it's extremely suspicious that there's no information about brains that didn't come from a brain
./data/Client3\sample-002914.mp3,only the lights in the great tent remained
./data/Client3\sample-002915.mp3,something inside the cylinder was unscrewing the top
./data/Client3\sample-002916.mp3,it took him a while to get to the office
./data/Client3\sample-002917.mp3,has aunt stephanie come in yet
./data/Client3\sample-002918.mp3,the wind told me that you know about love the boy said to the sun
./data/Client3\sample-002919.mp3,he was planning as he left the bar
./data/Client3\sample-002920.mp3,what do you know about that
./data/Client3\sample-002921.mp3,henderson stood up with a spade in his hand
./data/Client3\sample-002922.mp3,august may have ended early
./data/Client3\sample-002923.mp3,his life and his path had always provided him with enough omens
./data/Client3\sample-002924.mp3,the oxygen's only to help him till the doctor gets here
./data/Client3\sample-002925.mp3,where do you live shouted the boy as the horseman rode away
./data/Client3\sample-002926.mp3,he wasn't an alchemist
./data/Client3\sample-002927.mp3,not even the tribal chieftains are able to see him when they want to
./data/Client3\sample-002928.mp3,your son went to serve at a distant place and became a centurion
./data/Client3\sample-002929.mp3,many telescopes were pointed at it
./data/Client3\sample-002930.mp3,i'm the answer to your prayer
./data/Client3\sample-002931.mp3,it's like the flight of those two hawks it can't be understood by reason alone
./data/Client3\sample-002932.mp3,because my eyes are not yet accustomed to the desert the boy said
./data/Client3\sample-002933.mp3,there were really i think two or three hundred people elbowing one another
./data/Client3\sample-002934.mp3,the boy thought about the crystal merchant
./data/Client3\sample-002935.mp3,i thought that everything i owned would be destroyed
./data/Client3\sample-002936.mp3,my tax dollars pay for those public school proms
./data/Client3\sample-002937.mp3,he suggested that the boy look around the palace and return in two hours
./data/Client3\sample-002938.mp3,he'll be ready on time
./data/Client3\sample-002939.mp3,then you taught me something of the universal language and the soul of the world
./data/Client3\sample-002940.mp3,if it were he would already have heard of it
./data/Client3\sample-002941.mp3,i think they perceived that nothing was to be done at the moment
./data/Client3\sample-002942.mp3,the boy stepped closer to the girl and when she smiled he did the same
./data/Client3\sample-002943.mp3,i didn't need to waste my time just for this he said
./data/Client3\sample-002944.mp3,this recording is corrupted
./data/Client3\sample-002945.mp3,about eleven i walked back to my home in maybury because nothing seemed to be happening
./data/Client3\sample-002946.mp3,what is an alchemist he asked finally
./data/Client3\sample-002947.mp3,what is it that i still need to know the boy asked
./data/Client3\sample-002948.mp3,i have known true alchemists the alchemist continued
./data/Client3\sample-002949.mp3,i'm leaving today said the boy
./data/Client3\sample-002950.mp3,what do i do in salem the old man laughed
./data/Client3\sample-002951.mp3,she would never know the difference because she didn't know how to read
./data/Client3\sample-002952.mp3,anything i can do back here
./data/Client3\sample-002953.mp3,you don't have to be rich skinny popular or even own a cape to perform a random act of kindness
./data/Client3\sample-002954.mp3,i'll take that bet
./data/Client3\sample-002955.mp3,i don't know how to find life in the desert the boy said
./data/Client3\sample-002956.mp3,noone knows what's behind this gate
./data/Client3\sample-002957.mp3,walking along in the silence he had no regrets
./data/Client3\sample-002958.mp3,there's millions of ways
./data/Client3\sample-002959.mp3,they shouted consolation and promises and went off back to the town again to get help
./data/Client3\sample-002960.mp3,maybe tomorrow said the boy moving away
./data/Client3\sample-002961.mp3,how is the weather ubuntu
./data/Client3\sample-002962.mp3,there's one that says 'everything that happens once can never happen again
./data/Client3\sample-002963.mp3,the two men hurried back and found the cylinder still lying in the same position
./data/Client3\sample-002964.mp3,i'd love to see you try and convince them of that
./data/Client3\sample-002965.mp3,an ultimatum from edward and this one's final
./data/Client3\sample-002966.mp3,and i want you to know that i'm coming back
./data/Client3\sample-002967.mp3,have liv call me in the restaurant in twenty minutes
./data/Client3\sample-002968.mp3,and you've told me about omens
./data/Client3\sample-002969.mp3,something smells around here
./data/Client3\sample-002970.mp3,wasting my time listening to this mad hatter
./data/Client3\sample-002971.mp3,and he looked out over the desert that had brought him to the woman he loved
./data/Client3\sample-002972.mp3,don't give in to your fears said the alchemist in a strangely gentle voice
./data/Client3\sample-002973.mp3,then came the night of the first falling star
./data/Client3\sample-002974.mp3,the englishman asked if they were in danger
./data/Client3\sample-002975.mp3,you don't have to wait till january
./data/Client3\sample-002976.mp3,some of the grey ash was falling off the circular edge
./data/Client3\sample-002977.mp3,the boy looked out at the horizon
./data/Client3\sample-002978.mp3,despair is something that haunts us at night
./data/Client3\sample-002979.mp3,there were really i think two or three hundred people elbowing one another
./data/Client3\sample-002980.mp3,the years of research the magic symbols the strange words and the laboratory equipment
./data/Client3\sample-002981.mp3,your wife was wanted by the university of florida
./data/Client3\sample-002982.mp3,the englishman vanished too gone to find the alchemist
./data/Client3\sample-002983.mp3,the wind approached the boy and touched his face
./data/Client3\sample-002984.mp3,where's your coat and hat
./data/Client3\sample-002985.mp3,it's extremely suspicious that there's no information about brains that didn't come from a brain
./data/Client3\sample-002986.mp3,it was starlight and i explained the signs of the zodiac to her
./data/Client3\sample-002987.mp3,this can arouse national interest
./data/Client3\sample-002988.mp3,all that time the martians must have been getting ready
./data/Client3\sample-002989.mp3,the wind told me that you know about love the boy said to the sun
./data/Client3\sample-002990.mp3,he was able to get on his knees but he quickly slipped back
./data/Client3\sample-002991.mp3,he decided to spend the night there
./data/Client3\sample-002992.mp3,if you start your emails with greetings let me be the first to welcome you to earth
./data/Client3\sample-002993.mp3,besides that there was a heap of bicycles
./data/Client3\sample-002994.mp3,it was glaringly hot not a cloud in the sky nor a breath of wind
./data/Client3\sample-002995.mp3,that's the way it always is said the old man
./data/Client3\sample-002996.mp3,some of the presented conclusions are not supported by the reported results
./data/Client3\sample-002997.mp3,you point to a trail of ants leading into the house
./data/Client3\sample-002998.mp3,kate frank's a baker
./data/Client3\sample-002999.mp3,we'll carry the desk over
