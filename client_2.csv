./data/Client2\sample-001000.mp3,there was a full moon and the boy told the englishman the story of his life
./data/Client2\sample-001001.mp3,what would i have to say
./data/Client2\sample-001002.mp3,the boy thought about the crystal merchant
./data/Client2\sample-001003.mp3,about eleven i walked back to my home in maybury because nothing seemed to be happening
./data/Client2\sample-001004.mp3,wasting my time listening to this mad hatter
./data/Client2\sample-001005.mp3,everything'll be taken care of
./data/Client2\sample-001006.mp3,you can't trust anybody in this crazy world
./data/Client2\sample-001007.mp3,am i going to find my treasure he asked
./data/Client2\sample-001008.mp3,at once he connected the two incidents
./data/Client2\sample-001009.mp3,i've had this shop for thirty years
./data/Client2\sample-001010.mp3,besides that there was a heap of bicycles
./data/Client2\sample-001011.mp3,mister kristen has something to say to us
./data/Client2\sample-001012.mp3,i've already told you
./data/Client2\sample-001013.mp3,when i had my sheep i was happy and i made those around me happy
./data/Client2\sample-001014.mp3,i'll always let you down
./data/Client2\sample-001015.mp3,at the highest point in tarifa there is an old fort built by the moors
./data/Client2\sample-001016.mp3,and the odor of the animals became a bit more tolerable
./data/Client2\sample-001017.mp3,but i sort of like him
./data/Client2\sample-001018.mp3,it was only when i got this close to it that the strangeness of it was at all evident to me
./data/Client2\sample-001019.mp3,there is only one way to learn the alchemist answered
./data/Client2\sample-001020.mp3,i never had any such idea
./data/Client2\sample-001021.mp3,many of them had been right about what they said while some had been wrong
./data/Client2\sample-001022.mp3,it was rising slowly and painfully out of the cylinder
./data/Client2\sample-001023.mp3,why was it that he wanted the boy to serve as his instrument
./data/Client2\sample-001024.mp3,he remembered something his grandfather had once told him that butterflies were a good omen
./data/Client2\sample-001025.mp3,everything on earth is being continuously transformed because the earth is alive
./data/Client2\sample-001026.mp3,sadly my dream of becoming a squirrel whisperer may never happen
./data/Client2\sample-001027.mp3,sometimes i appear in the form of a solution or a good idea
./data/Client2\sample-001028.mp3,worked hard just to have food and water like the sheep
./data/Client2\sample-001029.mp3,as i watched the planet seemed to grow larger and smaller
./data/Client2\sample-001030.mp3,i have to separate out the sulfur
./data/Client2\sample-001031.mp3,she wasn't her type
./data/Client2\sample-001032.mp3,it was a cobra whose venom could kill a person in minutes
./data/Client2\sample-001033.mp3,i saw astonishment and horror on the faces of the people around me
./data/Client2\sample-001034.mp3,we took all the chances
./data/Client2\sample-001035.mp3,he didn't need to demonstrate his science and art to anyone
./data/Client2\sample-001036.mp3,all the words you've got
./data/Client2\sample-001037.mp3,if i could i'd write a huge encyclopedia just about the words luck and coincidence
./data/Client2\sample-001038.mp3,the genies were the spirits of good and evil
./data/Client2\sample-001039.mp3,but i'm liable to get into a jam
./data/Client2\sample-001040.mp3,there was very little talking
./data/Client2\sample-001041.mp3,the crowd swayed a little as i elbowed my way through
./data/Client2\sample-001042.mp3,the two men hurried back and found the cylinder still lying in the same position
./data/Client2\sample-001043.mp3,i can't do that
./data/Client2\sample-001044.mp3,what is it about
./data/Client2\sample-001045.mp3,i think somebody stole one of his crown jewels
./data/Client2\sample-001046.mp3,i've already had that experience with my sheep and now it's happening with people
./data/Client2\sample-001047.mp3,that was the law of hospitality
./data/Client2\sample-001048.mp3,he was older and was carrying a small bucket
./data/Client2\sample-001049.mp3,i'll cover the method i use and describe some alternatives
./data/Client2\sample-001050.mp3,the night was warm and i was thirsty
./data/Client2\sample-001051.mp3,the boy was sad as he left her that day
./data/Client2\sample-001052.mp3,kelly was interested in clearing up her brother's death
./data/Client2\sample-001053.mp3,then she took both of his hands in hers and began quietly to pray
./data/Client2\sample-001054.mp3,put down that chair
./data/Client2\sample-001055.mp3,i had the everyone has gary busey's teeth dream again
./data/Client2\sample-001056.mp3,and their eyes spoke of death
./data/Client2\sample-001057.mp3,he's allergic to him
./data/Client2\sample-001058.mp3,henderson stood up with a spade in his hand
./data/Client2\sample-001059.mp3,a man down on earth needs our help
./data/Client2\sample-001060.mp3,the alchemist dismounted slowly and the boy did the same
./data/Client2\sample-001061.mp3,an huge hole had been made by the impact of the projectile
./data/Client2\sample-001062.mp3,the lead had dried into the shape of the pan but it was no longer lead
./data/Client2\sample-001063.mp3,it sure looks good from here
./data/Client2\sample-001064.mp3,i had to test your courage the stranger said
./data/Client2\sample-001065.mp3,when the pan had cooled the monk and the boy looked at it dazzled
./data/Client2\sample-001066.mp3,most of them were staring quietly at the big table
./data/Client2\sample-001067.mp3,i'm never more aware of a room's acoustics than when i'm trying to enjoy a snack i have no intention of sharing
./data/Client2\sample-001068.mp3,i'm never more aware of a room's acoustics than when i'm trying to enjoy a snack i have no intention of sharing
./data/Client2\sample-001069.mp3,i think i found something
./data/Client2\sample-001070.mp3,you are almost at the end of your journey said the alchemist
./data/Client2\sample-001071.mp3,this samantha tommy movement costs you a fortune
./data/Client2\sample-001072.mp3,they formed heaps that are visible a mile and a half away
./data/Client2\sample-001073.mp3,when he was a child that man wanted to travel too
./data/Client2\sample-001074.mp3,and you've told me nothing along the way said the boy
./data/Client2\sample-001075.mp3,he took back his books and packed them away again in their bags
./data/Client2\sample-001076.mp3,but she said nothing
./data/Client2\sample-001077.mp3,i forgot you were here
./data/Client2\sample-001078.mp3,she and heather were talking
./data/Client2\sample-001079.mp3,it may be the gases of the firing that caused the martians inconvenience
./data/Client2\sample-001080.mp3,this ethical question is referred to as the trolley problem
./data/Client2\sample-001081.mp3,and then there were the others who were interested only in gold
./data/Client2\sample-001082.mp3,she refilled her vessel and left
./data/Client2\sample-001083.mp3,the boy wanted to take her hand
./data/Client2\sample-001084.mp3,there were really i think two or three hundred people elbowing one another
./data/Client2\sample-001085.mp3,two days later the merchant spoke to the boy about the display
./data/Client2\sample-001086.mp3,i don't like people to do that because the sheep are afraid of strangers
./data/Client2\sample-001087.mp3,he fondled his bright orange beard
./data/Client2\sample-001088.mp3,starting with his own
./data/Client2\sample-001089.mp3,as i watched the planet seemed to grow larger and smaller
./data/Client2\sample-001090.mp3,he wanted your money he said
./data/Client2\sample-001091.mp3,we'll fix you up
./data/Client2\sample-001092.mp3,the twenty million dollar project is projected to be finished in eight weeks
./data/Client2\sample-001093.mp3,as i watched the planet seemed to grow larger and smaller
./data/Client2\sample-001094.mp3,but one of them seized the boy and yanked him back out of the hole
./data/Client2\sample-001095.mp3,but that was simply because my eye was tired
./data/Client2\sample-001096.mp3,it was the levanter the wind that came from africa
./data/Client2\sample-001097.mp3,it is i who dared to do so said the boy
./data/Client2\sample-001098.mp3,that he had attended a seminary until he was sixteen
./data/Client2\sample-001099.mp3,the woman said she had never heard of such a person and hurried away
./data/Client2\sample-001100.mp3,i tore him apart
./data/Client2\sample-001101.mp3,there were lights in the upper windows of the houses when the people went to bed
./data/Client2\sample-001102.mp3,he had helped him out in a dangerous situation
./data/Client2\sample-001103.mp3,you know what i mean
./data/Client2\sample-001104.mp3,perhaps she forgot all about it
./data/Client2\sample-001105.mp3,you have a mania for simplifying everything answered the englishman irritated
./data/Client2\sample-001106.mp3,august may have ended early
./data/Client2\sample-001107.mp3,you can't believe it's not butter
./data/Client2\sample-001108.mp3,get your guns out
./data/Client2\sample-001109.mp3,i'm going to find that damned alchemist the englishman thought
./data/Client2\sample-001110.mp3,this is the press room
./data/Client2\sample-001111.mp3,that's not true the boy said
./data/Client2\sample-001112.mp3,the boy and the englishman had bought camels and climbed uncertainly onto their backs
./data/Client2\sample-001113.mp3,can i get a woot woot
./data/Client2\sample-001114.mp3,he knew he was stronger than his friend
./data/Client2\sample-001115.mp3,get me walter burns
./data/Client2\sample-001116.mp3,looking down at the spoon he held the boy saw that the oil was gone
./data/Client2\sample-001117.mp3,the englishman said nothing
./data/Client2\sample-001118.mp3,she was accused of making wrong accusations
./data/Client2\sample-001119.mp3,this was the strangest of all things that ever came to earth from outer space
./data/Client2\sample-001120.mp3,i'm coming fatima he said
./data/Client2\sample-001121.mp3,they were on the right track
./data/Client2\sample-001122.mp3,that's when he caught your cold
./data/Client2\sample-001123.mp3,you can't go any farther one of them said
./data/Client2\sample-001124.mp3,and their eyes spoke of death
./data/Client2\sample-001125.mp3,but men began to reject simple things and to write tracts interpretations and philosophical studies
./data/Client2\sample-001126.mp3,it's going to take a while the boy said
./data/Client2\sample-001127.mp3,you been in a fight
./data/Client2\sample-001128.mp3,and they attacked an empty tent
./data/Client2\sample-001129.mp3,aren't you allowed to kiss back
./data/Client2\sample-001130.mp3,the boy said nothing
./data/Client2\sample-001131.mp3,but now the sounds inside had stopped
./data/Client2\sample-001132.mp3,the time must have been somewhere around six o'clock
./data/Client2\sample-001133.mp3,henderson stood up with a spade in his hand
./data/Client2\sample-001134.mp3,you could have died after peace had been declared
./data/Client2\sample-001135.mp3,you don't have to be rich skinny popular or even own a cape to perform a random act of kindness
./data/Client2\sample-001136.mp3,everyone toasted the bride and groom
./data/Client2\sample-001137.mp3,but he still couldn't flee
./data/Client2\sample-001138.mp3,you must love the desert but never trust it completely
./data/Client2\sample-001139.mp3,it must have fallen while i was sitting over there
./data/Client2\sample-001140.mp3,it's a temporary tattoo that looks like a color wheel
./data/Client2\sample-001141.mp3,edinburgh is a dreamlike place to visit
./data/Client2\sample-001142.mp3,the baby definitely has the sniffles
./data/Client2\sample-001143.mp3,look around some time
./data/Client2\sample-001144.mp3,the following night the boy appeared at the alchemist's tent with a horse
./data/Client2\sample-001145.mp3,the shop folks were taking down their shutters and people were opening their bedroom windows
./data/Client2\sample-001146.mp3,the loafers and golf caddies were used to hanging out near the railway station
./data/Client2\sample-001147.mp3,have you seen sheriff pink
./data/Client2\sample-001148.mp3,at that time it was quite clear in my own mind that the thing had come from the planet mars
./data/Client2\sample-001149.mp3,he had used the two stones only once one morning when he was at a marketplace
./data/Client2\sample-001150.mp3,but the boy knew that he was referring to fatima
./data/Client2\sample-001151.mp3,that he had attended a seminary until he was sixteen
./data/Client2\sample-001152.mp3,and one or two persons were returning
./data/Client2\sample-001153.mp3,the greatest authority on meteorites stated that the height of its first appearance was about ninety or one hundred miles
./data/Client2\sample-001154.mp3,you didn't have to do any cleaning he said
./data/Client2\sample-001155.mp3,learn to recognize omens and follow them the old king had said
./data/Client2\sample-001156.mp3,an huge hole had been made by the impact of the projectile
./data/Client2\sample-001157.mp3,i'll show you what i'm doing
./data/Client2\sample-001158.mp3,a large piece suddenly came off and fell with a loud and sharp noise
./data/Client2\sample-001159.mp3,wait for the end of the war
./data/Client2\sample-001160.mp3,the referee decided on a free kick instead of a penalty kick
./data/Client2\sample-001161.mp3,the sun was setting when the boy's heart sounded a danger signal
./data/Client2\sample-001162.mp3,the strange horseman drew an enormous curved sword from a scabbard mounted on his saddle
./data/Client2\sample-001163.mp3,who asked you to get stuck with any of them
./data/Client2\sample-001164.mp3,the time must have been somewhere around six o'clock
./data/Client2\sample-001165.mp3,that's true the boy thought
./data/Client2\sample-001166.mp3,all the joy he had seen that morning had suddenly disappeared
./data/Client2\sample-001167.mp3,what would become of the doctor now that he had saved so many
./data/Client2\sample-001168.mp3,i have the money i need to buy my sheep
./data/Client2\sample-001169.mp3,break this crowd up
./data/Client2\sample-001170.mp3,accidents in nuclear power plants are potentially catastrophic
./data/Client2\sample-001171.mp3,if he were fed on time he wouldn't cry
./data/Client2\sample-001172.mp3,at once he connected the two incidents
./data/Client2\sample-001173.mp3,the tea seemed less bitter
./data/Client2\sample-001174.mp3,i have already described the appearance of that colossal bulk which was embedded in the ground
./data/Client2\sample-001175.mp3,he approached the mass and was surprised at the size and the shape
./data/Client2\sample-001176.mp3,ogilvy told him everything that he had seen
./data/Client2\sample-001177.mp3,you got plenty of money
./data/Client2\sample-001178.mp3,ogilvy told him everything that he had seen
./data/Client2\sample-001179.mp3,the levanter was still getting stronger and he felt its force on his face
./data/Client2\sample-001180.mp3,full steam ahead said the captain
./data/Client2\sample-001181.mp3,the boy waited and then interrupted the old man just as he himself had been interrupted
./data/Client2\sample-001182.mp3,it's called the principle of favorability
./data/Client2\sample-001183.mp3,the omens had been true after all
./data/Client2\sample-001184.mp3,that day he didn't make a cast
./data/Client2\sample-001185.mp3,suddenly there is so much more time in a day because she no longer has to spend hours commuting
./data/Client2\sample-001186.mp3,and then he would ask us to go back to our easels and replicate all the techniques in one go
./data/Client2\sample-001187.mp3,it was his heart that would tell him where his treasure was hidden
./data/Client2\sample-001188.mp3,then suddenly he noticed it with a start
./data/Client2\sample-001189.mp3,you've got a nerve accusing people of things
./data/Client2\sample-001190.mp3,i was just going to
./data/Client2\sample-001191.mp3,the jacket had a purpose and so did the boy
./data/Client2\sample-001192.mp3,what'll i tell him
./data/Client2\sample-001193.mp3,the first rule of don't fight club is let's talk about it
./data/Client2\sample-001194.mp3,he told fatima that at their next meeting
./data/Client2\sample-001195.mp3,he didn't need to seek out the old woman for this
./data/Client2\sample-001196.mp3,we don't know what's in the confounded thing do you
./data/Client2\sample-001197.mp3,the boy brought his horse closer
./data/Client2\sample-001198.mp3,i thought you were going to teach me some of the things you know
./data/Client2\sample-001199.mp3,he took his plate grabbed a knife and fork and scowled at the savagery on television
./data/Client2\sample-001200.mp3,what are you doing there
./data/Client2\sample-001201.mp3,if you want something you gotta go get it
./data/Client2\sample-001202.mp3,the people were also praying to heaven for protection
./data/Client2\sample-001203.mp3,their software does not listen for virtual keypresses
./data/Client2\sample-001204.mp3,and then he perceived it very slowly
./data/Client2\sample-001205.mp3,he came to understand its dodges and tricks and to accept it as it was
./data/Client2\sample-001206.mp3,it could get a whole lot worse
./data/Client2\sample-001207.mp3,he has other things to do first
./data/Client2\sample-001208.mp3,you have a mania for simplifying everything answered the englishman irritated
./data/Client2\sample-001209.mp3,besides that there was a heap of bicycles
./data/Client2\sample-001210.mp3,replace the ts in tim tebow's name with any other consonant to get a star wars character
./data/Client2\sample-001211.mp3,catherine walked alongside the canal
./data/Client2\sample-001212.mp3,you should see the other guy specifically how good at fighting he is
./data/Client2\sample-001213.mp3,it was a bundle of money
./data/Client2\sample-001214.mp3,she wants to send you on a lecture tour
./data/Client2\sample-001215.mp3,i have no information about troops or about the movement of the tribes
./data/Client2\sample-001216.mp3,i think it's plenty terrific
./data/Client2\sample-001217.mp3,some of those who saw its flight say it travelled with a hissing sound
./data/Client2\sample-001218.mp3,i'll take mine now
./data/Client2\sample-001219.mp3,i thought sure you'd remember me
./data/Client2\sample-001220.mp3,i've crossed these sands many times said one of the camel drivers one night
./data/Client2\sample-001221.mp3,can you imagine that
./data/Client2\sample-001222.mp3,can you remember anything at all
./data/Client2\sample-001223.mp3,yes that's what love is
./data/Client2\sample-001224.mp3,most meteorites are more or less rounded
./data/Client2\sample-001225.mp3,and you can meet us at the station
./data/Client2\sample-001226.mp3,why did you want to see me the boy asked
./data/Client2\sample-001227.mp3,because you'll know its dreams and wishes and will know how to deal with them
./data/Client2\sample-001228.mp3,he remembered what the old man had said about offering something you didn't even have yet
./data/Client2\sample-001229.mp3,the sticker was peeling from the item
./data/Client2\sample-001230.mp3,i didn't come here to have you read my palm he said already regretting having come
./data/Client2\sample-001231.mp3,they set off running wildly into the trees
./data/Client2\sample-001232.mp3,it spread through the planet's atmosphere and obscured its more familiar features
./data/Client2\sample-001233.mp3,so he asked if the old man's blessing was still with him
./data/Client2\sample-001234.mp3,i'm doing much better and soon you'll be able to return to your sheep
./data/Client2\sample-001235.mp3,all beverages in this shop are free of alcohol
./data/Client2\sample-001236.mp3,there's nothing more we can do tonight
./data/Client2\sample-001237.mp3,not with my money
./data/Client2\sample-001238.mp3,the alchemist rode in front with the falcon on his shoulder
./data/Client2\sample-001239.mp3,it was starlight and i explained the signs of the zodiac to her
./data/Client2\sample-001240.mp3,i think somebody stole one of his crown jewels
./data/Client2\sample-001241.mp3,they never have to make any decisions he thought
./data/Client2\sample-001242.mp3,then the thing came upon him in a flash
./data/Client2\sample-001243.mp3,a boy came running towards me
./data/Client2\sample-001244.mp3,there is not even the possibility of doing that
./data/Client2\sample-001245.mp3,what does he do all day
./data/Client2\sample-001246.mp3,to make it even faster i only allow onesyllable numbers to be used in labels
./data/Client2\sample-001247.mp3,the process is a bit complicated due to recent changes that have limited the free feature set in version 
./data/Client2\sample-001248.mp3,the boy didn't know what to say
./data/Client2\sample-001249.mp3,i was just asking
./data/Client2\sample-001250.mp3,the vision vanished immediately but it had shaken him
./data/Client2\sample-001251.mp3,the speech will continue
./data/Client2\sample-001252.mp3,he needs three days answered the alchemist
./data/Client2\sample-001253.mp3,saul was infuriating the others
./data/Client2\sample-001254.mp3,well interpret the dream he said
./data/Client2\sample-001255.mp3,the boy went to the well every day to meet with fatima
./data/Client2\sample-001256.mp3,he did find it soon after dawn and not far from the sand pits
./data/Client2\sample-001257.mp3,down below in the darkness were hundreds of people sleeping in peace
./data/Client2\sample-001258.mp3,air was either entering or escaping at the rim with a thin sizzling sound
./data/Client2\sample-001259.mp3,i shall make us some ice cubes
./data/Client2\sample-001260.mp3,from where i am the sun said i can see the soul of the world
./data/Client2\sample-001261.mp3,no offense but your agility leaves a lot to be desired
./data/Client2\sample-001262.mp3,you can't go any farther one of them said
./data/Client2\sample-001263.mp3,and one can always come back
./data/Client2\sample-001264.mp3,the hookahs were extinguished and the guards stood at attention
./data/Client2\sample-001265.mp3,i won't shut up
./data/Client2\sample-001266.mp3,i need ten dollars
./data/Client2\sample-001267.mp3,the three fell silent
./data/Client2\sample-001268.mp3,well it's a long list
./data/Client2\sample-001269.mp3,the angel touched the man's shoulder and they were both projected far into the future
./data/Client2\sample-001270.mp3,i'm going to become bitter and distrustful of people because one person betrayed me
./data/Client2\sample-001271.mp3,you can't go in there until you put this on
./data/Client2\sample-001272.mp3,a hundred nuns stampeded the vatican
./data/Client2\sample-001273.mp3,now go eat your dinner
./data/Client2\sample-001274.mp3,at most they thought that another meteorite had descended
./data/Client2\sample-001275.mp3,the owner of the bar came over and looked as well
./data/Client2\sample-001276.mp3,in one he had read that many years ago a famous arabian alchemist had visited europe
./data/Client2\sample-001277.mp3,i thought about the difficulties in translation that might arise
./data/Client2\sample-001278.mp3,people saw me coming and welcomed me he thought
./data/Client2\sample-001279.mp3,i suppose all this is leading somewhere
./data/Client2\sample-001280.mp3,if i could i'd write a huge encyclopedia just about the words luck and coincidence
./data/Client2\sample-001281.mp3,but she hadn't charged him anything
./data/Client2\sample-001282.mp3,he must be disguised to avoid encounters with thieves
./data/Client2\sample-001283.mp3,the boy mumbled an answer that allowed him to avoid responding to her question
./data/Client2\sample-001284.mp3,he took out his money and counted it
./data/Client2\sample-001285.mp3,the boy was surprised
./data/Client2\sample-001286.mp3,the immense collection of people and animals began to travel faster
./data/Client2\sample-001287.mp3,none of this ha d made an impression on the boy
./data/Client2\sample-001288.mp3,you will be jane doe
./data/Client2\sample-001289.mp3,suddenly he disappeared and i could hear a faint shriek behind the walls
./data/Client2\sample-001290.mp3,the stranger was speaking of things that very few people knew about
./data/Client2\sample-001291.mp3,and he wasn't faring much better
./data/Client2\sample-001292.mp3,if i don't find it i can always go home
./data/Client2\sample-001293.mp3,even the guides spoke very little to one another
./data/Client2\sample-001294.mp3,he remembered something his grandfather had once told him that butterflies were a good omen
./data/Client2\sample-001295.mp3,but then they wouldn't be a part of your future the seer had said
./data/Client2\sample-001296.mp3,on the very first page it described a burial ceremony
./data/Client2\sample-001297.mp3,it seemed so safe and tranquil
./data/Client2\sample-001298.mp3,lots of shepherds passed through selling their wool
./data/Client2\sample-001299.mp3,few people realise the immensity of vacancy
./data/Client2\sample-001300.mp3,i can't think of any reason why she was killed
./data/Client2\sample-001301.mp3,then you'll die in the midst of trying to realize your destiny
./data/Client2\sample-001302.mp3,it was as if it quivered but really this was the telescope vibrating
./data/Client2\sample-001303.mp3,and in that mood he was grateful to be in love
./data/Client2\sample-001304.mp3,i hate sneakers but i am liking these shoes
./data/Client2\sample-001305.mp3,i'm an adventurer looking for treasure he said to himself
./data/Client2\sample-001306.mp3,the boy knew the desert sensed his fear
./data/Client2\sample-001307.mp3,and there were dunes rocks and plants that insisted on living where survival seemed impossible
./data/Client2\sample-001308.mp3,he thought about asking him to give it back but decided that would be unfriendly
./data/Client2\sample-001309.mp3,it had a diameter of about thirty yards
./data/Client2\sample-001310.mp3,but it just so happens i've got a picture of her
./data/Client2\sample-001311.mp3,and your camels will bring you wealth and power
./data/Client2\sample-001312.mp3,the boy smiled and continued digging
./data/Client2\sample-001313.mp3,then came the night of the first falling star
./data/Client2\sample-001314.mp3,it spread through the planet's atmosphere and obscured its more familiar features
./data/Client2\sample-001315.mp3,and for wise men gold is the metal that evolved the furthest
./data/Client2\sample-001316.mp3,the shop folks were taking down their shutters and people were opening their bedroom windows
./data/Client2\sample-001317.mp3,the woman was silent for some time
./data/Client2\sample-001318.mp3,i'm playing for keeps
./data/Client2\sample-001319.mp3,a boy came running towards me
./data/Client2\sample-001320.mp3,even though the sheep didn't teach me to speak arabic
./data/Client2\sample-001321.mp3,have a good time
./data/Client2\sample-001322.mp3,these trousers don't fit very well
./data/Client2\sample-001323.mp3,she looks kind of bored
./data/Client2\sample-001324.mp3,i've got to go to him
./data/Client2\sample-001325.mp3,some storms are worth the wreckage
./data/Client2\sample-001326.mp3,carol saved her brother's life that day
./data/Client2\sample-001327.mp3,i've had this shop for thirty years
./data/Client2\sample-001328.mp3,never heard of such a thing
./data/Client2\sample-001329.mp3,you'll watch them as they grow demonstrating how the world is always changing
./data/Client2\sample-001330.mp3,wish i had a million dollars
./data/Client2\sample-001331.mp3,the englishman was unable to sleep one night
./data/Client2\sample-001332.mp3,about eleven i walked back to my home in maybury because nothing seemed to be happening
./data/Client2\sample-001333.mp3,you can't believe it's not butter
./data/Client2\sample-001334.mp3,and the solid part was called the philosopher's stone
./data/Client2\sample-001335.mp3,he decided to concentrate on more practical matters
./data/Client2\sample-001336.mp3,the runway seems way to short for this type of plane
./data/Client2\sample-001337.mp3,the manufacturer recommends it
./data/Client2\sample-001338.mp3,they're not worth much the englishman answered
./data/Client2\sample-001339.mp3,they're not for sale he said
./data/Client2\sample-001340.mp3,as he did so he talked with the monk about the tribal wars
./data/Client2\sample-001341.mp3,the level ground was blackened as far as one could see and it was still giving off smoke
./data/Client2\sample-001342.mp3,firewalls can be used to protect a network against intruders
./data/Client2\sample-001343.mp3,what's that got to do with it
./data/Client2\sample-001344.mp3,the visual acuity is astonishing
./data/Client2\sample-001345.mp3,my chinchilla eats bread
./data/Client2\sample-001346.mp3,could i please see you a minute
./data/Client2\sample-001347.mp3,but he kept quiet because he had heard what the alchemist said to the monk
./data/Client2\sample-001348.mp3,the two men hurried back and found the cylinder still lying in the same position
./data/Client2\sample-001349.mp3,but this'll teach them a lesson
./data/Client2\sample-001350.mp3,on the following day the first clear sign of danger appeared
./data/Client2\sample-001351.mp3,i need four hundred and fifty dollars in counterfeit money
./data/Client2\sample-001352.mp3,the strange horseman drew an enormous curved sword from a scabbard mounted on his saddle
./data/Client2\sample-001353.mp3,he tried again to concentrate on the pink shades of the desert and its stones
./data/Client2\sample-001354.mp3,that's why i'm here
./data/Client2\sample-001355.mp3,it looked like a rusty gas float
./data/Client2\sample-001356.mp3,you mean you and me
./data/Client2\sample-001357.mp3,the alchemist erased the circle in the sand and the snake slithered away among the rocks
./data/Client2\sample-001358.mp3,the two men hurried back and found the cylinder still lying in the same position
./data/Client2\sample-001359.mp3,well then help me do that the boy said
./data/Client2\sample-001360.mp3,i've got to go to him
./data/Client2\sample-001361.mp3,whatever the thing observed one could find a connection with his experience of the moment
./data/Client2\sample-001362.mp3,i thought about whether we should find coins and models in it and so on
./data/Client2\sample-001363.mp3,you'd better take it easy
./data/Client2\sample-001364.mp3,he found the toilet occupied
./data/Client2\sample-001365.mp3,you were going to go out and conquer the world
./data/Client2\sample-001366.mp3,the city sealer's office
./data/Client2\sample-001367.mp3,besides that there was a heap of bicycles
./data/Client2\sample-001368.mp3,wait for the end of the war
./data/Client2\sample-001369.mp3,few people realise the immensity of vacancy
./data/Client2\sample-001370.mp3,as the englishman left fatima arrived and filled her vessel with water
./data/Client2\sample-001371.mp3,henderson stood up with a spade in his hand
./data/Client2\sample-001372.mp3,i don't know about war
./data/Client2\sample-001373.mp3,among these people were a couple of cyclists a gardener i employed sometimes and a girl carrying a baby
./data/Client2\sample-001374.mp3,nothing's going to happen
./data/Client2\sample-001375.mp3,that's the philosopher's stone and the elixir of life
./data/Client2\sample-001376.mp3,the genies were the spirits of good and evil
./data/Client2\sample-001377.mp3,dense clouds of smoke or dust can be seen through a powerful telescope
./data/Client2\sample-001378.mp3,several figures approached him
./data/Client2\sample-001379.mp3,in his heart he wanted to remain awake but he also wanted to sleep
./data/Client2\sample-001380.mp3,i shouldn't have done that
./data/Client2\sample-001381.mp3,people say strange things the boy thought
./data/Client2\sample-001382.mp3,this morning i found a calculator taped to my wii
./data/Client2\sample-001383.mp3,at the first glance it was really not very exciting
./data/Client2\sample-001384.mp3,the merchant turned to a customer who wanted three crystal glasses
./data/Client2\sample-001385.mp3,gimme the receiving room
./data/Client2\sample-001386.mp3,what am i going to say to elvis
./data/Client2\sample-001387.mp3,who's down there with you
./data/Client2\sample-001388.mp3,what do you mean it's okay
./data/Client2\sample-001389.mp3,the wireless joypad was experiencing connection issues
./data/Client2\sample-001390.mp3,the guy thought he was a lunatic at large and made an unsuccessful attempt to stop him
./data/Client2\sample-001391.mp3,with the wars between the tribes it's impossible to cross the desert
./data/Client2\sample-001392.mp3,mrs jason is on the phone
./data/Client2\sample-001393.mp3,the guy thought he was a lunatic at large and made an unsuccessful attempt to stop him
./data/Client2\sample-001394.mp3,let me talk to him
./data/Client2\sample-001395.mp3,for at that time it had not occurred to him that it might be hollow
./data/Client2\sample-001396.mp3,the next day he gave his son a pouch that held three ancient spanish gold coins
./data/Client2\sample-001397.mp3,there is only one way to learn the alchemist answered
./data/Client2\sample-001398.mp3,and one or two persons were returning
./data/Client2\sample-001399.mp3,but everyone and his aunt lilian's been through that bag
./data/Client2\sample-001400.mp3,your son went to serve at a distant place and became a centurion
./data/Client2\sample-001401.mp3,the streamer of gas came out towards us
./data/Client2\sample-001402.mp3,everybody knows you're a sweetheart
./data/Client2\sample-001403.mp3,how would the method behave with kernels of different size
./data/Client2\sample-001404.mp3,what boat you sailing on
./data/Client2\sample-001405.mp3,mrs sarah doesn't either
./data/Client2\sample-001406.mp3,besides that there was a heap of bicycles
./data/Client2\sample-001407.mp3,they were all furious when the escapade failed
./data/Client2\sample-001408.mp3,it was linda keller
./data/Client2\sample-001409.mp3,who's that with the hat
./data/Client2\sample-001410.mp3,maybe tomorrow will be better than yesterday
./data/Client2\sample-001411.mp3,you must love the desert but never trust it completely
./data/Client2\sample-001412.mp3,the alchemist dismounted and told the escorts they could return to the camp
./data/Client2\sample-001413.mp3,he fell asleep and when he awoke the sun was already high
./data/Client2\sample-001414.mp3,hires two personal trainers and make one of them train the other one
./data/Client2\sample-001415.mp3,the woman sat down and told him to be seated as well
./data/Client2\sample-001416.mp3,it must have fallen while i was sitting over there
./data/Client2\sample-001417.mp3,let me tell you what will happen
./data/Client2\sample-001418.mp3,the boy saw a man appear behind the counter
./data/Client2\sample-001419.mp3,what are they doing the old man asked pointing at the people in the plaza
./data/Client2\sample-001420.mp3,he wrapped the twigs in a piece of cloth and put them back in his bag
./data/Client2\sample-001421.mp3,if we serve tea in crystal the shop is going to expand
./data/Client2\sample-001422.mp3,i'll give you three minutes to tell me where she is
./data/Client2\sample-001423.mp3,the plumber tightened the leaking valve
./data/Client2\sample-001424.mp3,don't they believe in angels
./data/Client2\sample-001425.mp3,when the judge spoke the death sentence the defendant showed no emotion
./data/Client2\sample-001426.mp3,it is i the boy answered
./data/Client2\sample-001427.mp3,i shall make us some ice cubes
./data/Client2\sample-001428.mp3,so it's better to listen to what it has to say
./data/Client2\sample-001429.mp3,so his heart was quiet for an entire afternoon
./data/Client2\sample-001430.mp3,nobody's trying to steal from you
./data/Client2\sample-001431.mp3,and it knew nothing about love
./data/Client2\sample-001432.mp3,she was throwing snowballs at the sky
./data/Client2\sample-001433.mp3,now who'da done a mean thing like that
./data/Client2\sample-001434.mp3,the pixel probabilities are conditioned on the model state
./data/Client2\sample-001435.mp3,the boy knew and was now working toward it
./data/Client2\sample-001436.mp3,at once he connected the two incidents
./data/Client2\sample-001437.mp3,you can't say that about my father
./data/Client2\sample-001438.mp3,it's got to be somewhere
./data/Client2\sample-001439.mp3,he just got a new kite for his birthday
./data/Client2\sample-001440.mp3,i got it back
./data/Client2\sample-001441.mp3,the boy watched as his companion went to his horse and withdrew a scimitar
./data/Client2\sample-001442.mp3,if i had told you you wouldn't have seen the pyramids
./data/Client2\sample-001443.mp3,the biological threat was contained
./data/Client2\sample-001444.mp3,the night was warm and i was thirsty
./data/Client2\sample-001445.mp3,we're going to take her over to my private office
./data/Client2\sample-001446.mp3,henderson was taking it in
./data/Client2\sample-001447.mp3,the pixel probabilities are conditioned on the model state
./data/Client2\sample-001448.mp3,i'm surprised the boy said
./data/Client2\sample-001449.mp3,there were really i think two or three hundred people elbowing one another
./data/Client2\sample-001450.mp3,there's gold here he said
./data/Client2\sample-001451.mp3,he has other things to do first
./data/Client2\sample-001452.mp3,the boy began again to read his book but he was no longer able to concentrate
./data/Client2\sample-001453.mp3,then you'll die in the midst of trying to realize your destiny
./data/Client2\sample-001454.mp3,i'm afraid you put them on too early
./data/Client2\sample-001455.mp3,the criminal courts building
./data/Client2\sample-001456.mp3,his life and his path had always provided him with enough omens
./data/Client2\sample-001457.mp3,the jacket had a purpose and so did the boy
./data/Client2\sample-001458.mp3,or a man into the wind
./data/Client2\sample-001459.mp3,i don't know why
./data/Client2\sample-001460.mp3,i don't know why
./data/Client2\sample-001461.mp3,this is a resourceintensive process that requires expensive closedsource speech data to get a good model
./data/Client2\sample-001462.mp3,most meteorites are more or less rounded
./data/Client2\sample-001463.mp3,she supports a mother and two kids
./data/Client2\sample-001464.mp3,our deadline is coming up rapidly and we will need help
./data/Client2\sample-001465.mp3,we've passed her up right along
./data/Client2\sample-001466.mp3,i'm afraid that if my dream is realized i'll have no reason to go on living
./data/Client2\sample-001467.mp3,i like the way she talks
./data/Client2\sample-001468.mp3,what is love the desert asked
./data/Client2\sample-001469.mp3,the hydrogen gas escaped
./data/Client2\sample-001470.mp3,now i will drift gently off to dreamland
./data/Client2\sample-001471.mp3,having heard that the boy became even more interested in alchemy
./data/Client2\sample-001472.mp3,our religion dictates our actions
./data/Client2\sample-001473.mp3,the problem is that they don't even realize that they're walking a new road every day
./data/Client2\sample-001474.mp3,he seemed unfriendly and had looked irritated when the boy had entered
./data/Client2\sample-001475.mp3,i think it's marvelous
./data/Client2\sample-001476.mp3,but there was something there in his heart that wouldn't allow him to do so
./data/Client2\sample-001477.mp3,my tax dollars pay for those public school proms
./data/Client2\sample-001478.mp3,how often do you go through this little ritual
./data/Client2\sample-001479.mp3,she saved the lives of every man on that transport
./data/Client2\sample-001480.mp3,the crowd swayed a little as i elbowed my way through
./data/Client2\sample-001481.mp3,from that day on the oasis would be an empty place for her
./data/Client2\sample-001482.mp3,every time he saw her he felt nervous
./data/Client2\sample-001483.mp3,the englishman didn't answer him directly
./data/Client2\sample-001484.mp3,we always observe the tradition
./data/Client2\sample-001485.mp3,maybe we're all that way the boy mused
./data/Client2\sample-001486.mp3,a line of flame high can be seen in the atmosphere
./data/Client2\sample-001487.mp3,keep me here until i get over it
./data/Client2\sample-001488.mp3,he understands the forces of nature
./data/Client2\sample-001489.mp3,it was as if it quivered but really this was the telescope vibrating
./data/Client2\sample-001490.mp3,i want to tell you a story about dreams said the alchemist
./data/Client2\sample-001491.mp3,except for the dream
./data/Client2\sample-001492.mp3,i can't let her out
./data/Client2\sample-001493.mp3,i'll tell you what i'll do
./data/Client2\sample-001494.mp3,it's called the principle of favorability beginner's luck
./data/Client2\sample-001495.mp3,we've got her located
./data/Client2\sample-001496.mp3,it is i who dared to do so said the boy
./data/Client2\sample-001497.mp3,they spoke about mercury salt dragons and kings and he didn't understand any of it
./data/Client2\sample-001498.mp3,i'll talk to you tonight
./data/Client2\sample-001499.mp3,the vision vanished immediately but it had shaken him
./data/Client2\sample-001500.mp3,i don't blame him
./data/Client2\sample-001501.mp3,this is a trick to get your sympathy
./data/Client2\sample-001502.mp3,the old man said nothing
./data/Client2\sample-001503.mp3,the boy thought it a strange question
./data/Client2\sample-001504.mp3,i think they perceived that nothing was to be done at the moment
./data/Client2\sample-001505.mp3,aldo and his grandma quickly discovered a new passion for coding
./data/Client2\sample-001506.mp3,and i'm certain you'll find it the alchemist said
./data/Client2\sample-001507.mp3,can't you just observe men and omens in order to understand the language the boy asked
./data/Client2\sample-001508.mp3,i learned the alchemist's secrets in my travels
./data/Client2\sample-001509.mp3,then he took from his knapsack a bottle of wine and drank some
./data/Client2\sample-001510.mp3,you been in a fight
./data/Client2\sample-001511.mp3,they made the boy continue digging but he found nothing
./data/Client2\sample-001512.mp3,he was just and good
./data/Client2\sample-001513.mp3,he became friendly with the camel driver who traveled alongside him
./data/Client2\sample-001514.mp3,isn't it a little crowded
./data/Client2\sample-001515.mp3,somehow the purple colour faded to gray
./data/Client2\sample-001516.mp3,you'll live and you'll learn that a man shouldn't be so stupid
./data/Client2\sample-001517.mp3,i've been to your house a hundred times
./data/Client2\sample-001518.mp3,turn on the lights
./data/Client2\sample-001519.mp3,it brought his heart into his mouth
./data/Client2\sample-001520.mp3,give me my book the boy said
./data/Client2\sample-001521.mp3,is this the place
./data/Client2\sample-001522.mp3,maybe these desert birds could explain to him the meaning of love without ownership
./data/Client2\sample-001523.mp3,it said that the darkest hour of the night came just before the dawn
./data/Client2\sample-001524.mp3,from the railway station in the distance came the sound of trains ringing and rumbling
./data/Client2\sample-001525.mp3,came to the bar he had entered on his first day there
./data/Client2\sample-001526.mp3,the first baseman dropped the ball
./data/Client2\sample-001527.mp3,scattered groups of people were hurrying from the direction of woking
./data/Client2\sample-001528.mp3,before the boy could reply a butterfly appeared and fluttered between him and the old man
./data/Client2\sample-001529.mp3,i guess i used all the shells
./data/Client2\sample-001530.mp3,some do come back
./data/Client2\sample-001531.mp3,one of the world's biggest problems is the growth of human population
./data/Client2\sample-001532.mp3,he believed in omens
./data/Client2\sample-001533.mp3,now i want to ask you fellows a couple of questions
./data/Client2\sample-001534.mp3,henderson was taking it in
./data/Client2\sample-001535.mp3,air was either entering or escaping at the rim with a thin sizzling sound
./data/Client2\sample-001536.mp3,i'm getting trevor ready
./data/Client2\sample-001537.mp3,look where you're going
./data/Client2\sample-001538.mp3,she will go down in history as the greatest brain surgeon in the world
./data/Client2\sample-001539.mp3,that's a lot of gold
./data/Client2\sample-001540.mp3,that day he didn't make a cast
./data/Client2\sample-001541.mp3,she looks as though she's going to come to
./data/Client2\sample-001542.mp3,he needed someone to talk to so as to avoid thinking about the possibility of war
./data/Client2\sample-001543.mp3,there's been too much talk going on in this world
./data/Client2\sample-001544.mp3,the coffee had a very strong taste
./data/Client2\sample-001545.mp3,you've put one administration out and another in
./data/Client2\sample-001546.mp3,some of the grey ash was falling off the circular edge
./data/Client2\sample-001547.mp3,you told me that
./data/Client2\sample-001548.mp3,the execution was cancelled
./data/Client2\sample-001549.mp3,the miner had abandoned everything to go mining for emeralds
./data/Client2\sample-001550.mp3,how strange africa is thought the boy
./data/Client2\sample-001551.mp3,but the marketplace was empty and he was far from home so he wept
./data/Client2\sample-001552.mp3,that's exactly what i thought
./data/Client2\sample-001553.mp3,but nowhere could he find his new companion
./data/Client2\sample-001554.mp3,so it's better to listen to what it has to say
./data/Client2\sample-001555.mp3,the population was increasing exponentially
./data/Client2\sample-001556.mp3,she's going to lose her mind when she finds out
./data/Client2\sample-001557.mp3,will i learn to do that someday the boy asked
./data/Client2\sample-001558.mp3,so what should i do now the boy asked
./data/Client2\sample-001559.mp3,i don't much like change he said
./data/Client2\sample-001560.mp3,edinburgh is a dreamlike place to visit
./data/Client2\sample-001561.mp3,love required them to stay with the people they loved
./data/Client2\sample-001562.mp3,it's not my house
./data/Client2\sample-001563.mp3,the stranger was speaking of things that very few people knew about
./data/Client2\sample-001564.mp3,some storms are worth the wreckage
./data/Client2\sample-001565.mp3,strange images passed through my mind
./data/Client2\sample-001566.mp3,so he began to wander through the city and found himself at the gates
./data/Client2\sample-001567.mp3,no one seemed to have thought about it that night
./data/Client2\sample-001568.mp3,almost everyone here speaks spanish
./data/Client2\sample-001569.mp3,then suppose you give me the money
./data/Client2\sample-001570.mp3,it was dropping off in flakes and raining down on the sand
./data/Client2\sample-001571.mp3,excuse me nudism is not allowed at this part of the beach
./data/Client2\sample-001572.mp3,it didn't even occur to the boy to flee
./data/Client2\sample-001573.mp3,someplace you could have put it
./data/Client2\sample-001574.mp3,revenge is not my style but obviously accidents will happen
./data/Client2\sample-001575.mp3,i haven't heard the baby complain yet
./data/Client2\sample-001576.mp3,scattered groups of people were hurrying from the direction of woking
./data/Client2\sample-001577.mp3,did you say a king he asked
./data/Client2\sample-001578.mp3,katie screamed that they were going to lose
./data/Client2\sample-001579.mp3,i don't think i know that one
./data/Client2\sample-001580.mp3,you'd better get dressed
./data/Client2\sample-001581.mp3,i'm going out and find them
./data/Client2\sample-001582.mp3,i myself heard nothing of that
./data/Client2\sample-001583.mp3,they wanted to save the oasis
./data/Client2\sample-001584.mp3,of course the two were unable to do anything
./data/Client2\sample-001585.mp3,let's go and have some lunch said the crystal merchant
./data/Client2\sample-001586.mp3,mr lee can't be bothered now
./data/Client2\sample-001587.mp3,sirens blared as they raced into the heart of the crowded metropolis
./data/Client2\sample-001588.mp3,what did you stop it for
./data/Client2\sample-001589.mp3,the omens will begin insistently to speak of it and you'll try to ignore them
./data/Client2\sample-001590.mp3,i'm just too miserable
./data/Client2\sample-001591.mp3,an alchemist said the alchemist
./data/Client2\sample-001592.mp3,well then we've got a problem
./data/Client2\sample-001593.mp3,and i'd better read your books said the boy
./data/Client2\sample-001594.mp3,that's not carson sphinx
./data/Client2\sample-001595.mp3,the immense collection of people and animals began to travel faster
./data/Client2\sample-001596.mp3,it was seen early in the morning rushing over eastward
./data/Client2\sample-001597.mp3,air was either entering or escaping at the rim with a thin sizzling sound
./data/Client2\sample-001598.mp3,what did you say
./data/Client2\sample-001599.mp3,an old man with a breastplate of gold wouldn't have lied just to acquire six sheep
./data/Client2\sample-001600.mp3,that's true the boy thought
./data/Client2\sample-001601.mp3,she didn't have one
./data/Client2\sample-001602.mp3,the man wept with happiness
./data/Client2\sample-001603.mp3,it was as if it quivered but really this was the telescope vibrating
./data/Client2\sample-001604.mp3,drink and enjoy yourself said the alchemist noticing that the boy was feeling happier
./data/Client2\sample-001605.mp3,the turf and gravel around it seemed charred as if by a sudden explosion
./data/Client2\sample-001606.mp3,what's your name he asked
./data/Client2\sample-001607.mp3,the englishman said nothing
./data/Client2\sample-001608.mp3,suppose there was a shane york and he walked into this office
./data/Client2\sample-001609.mp3,a boy came running towards me
./data/Client2\sample-001610.mp3,get your guns out
./data/Client2\sample-001611.mp3,listen to that mob
./data/Client2\sample-001612.mp3,what was all that
./data/Client2\sample-001613.mp3,dense clouds of smoke or dust can be seen through a powerful telescope
./data/Client2\sample-001614.mp3,an huge hole had been made by the impact of the projectile
./data/Client2\sample-001615.mp3,the reader does not need to know how it is actually computed
./data/Client2\sample-001616.mp3,now i too will be one of the women who wait
./data/Client2\sample-001617.mp3,the boy didn't want to talk about the pyramids
./data/Client2\sample-001618.mp3,and the murmur lasted longer than a simple vow would have
./data/Client2\sample-001619.mp3,what do i do in salem the old man laughed
./data/Client2\sample-001620.mp3,the pixel probabilities are conditioned on the model state
./data/Client2\sample-001621.mp3,you have enough gold to buy many sheep and many camels
./data/Client2\sample-001622.mp3,it was the first time either had touched the other
./data/Client2\sample-001623.mp3,i thought i'd give the kids a treat
./data/Client2\sample-001624.mp3,how strange africa is thought the boy
./data/Client2\sample-001625.mp3,he felt weighted down by the centuries of time since the pyramids had been built
./data/Client2\sample-001626.mp3,the treasure is at the pyramids that you already knew
./data/Client2\sample-001627.mp3,he saw the boy appear from the other side of the dunes
./data/Client2\sample-001628.mp3,if you pay attention to the present you can improve upon it
./data/Client2\sample-001629.mp3,he had always believed that the sheep were able to understand what he said
./data/Client2\sample-001630.mp3,after two hours he returned to the room where the wise man was
./data/Client2\sample-001631.mp3,replace the ts in tim tebow's name with any other consonant to get a star wars character
./data/Client2\sample-001632.mp3,he had never imagined that questions about life would be of such importance to a shepherd
./data/Client2\sample-001633.mp3,when he's an old man he's going to spend a month in africa
./data/Client2\sample-001634.mp3,the arabs laughed at him and the alchemist laughed along
./data/Client2\sample-001635.mp3,the boy preferred wine
./data/Client2\sample-001636.mp3,you're the one who may die the alchemist said
./data/Client2\sample-001637.mp3,and maybe it wasn't that they were teaching me but that i was learning from them
./data/Client2\sample-001638.mp3,because the crystal was dirty
./data/Client2\sample-001639.mp3,what kind of blow should one deliver next in order to remain alive
./data/Client2\sample-001640.mp3,but now the sounds inside had stopped
./data/Client2\sample-001641.mp3,there is a social facility on the other side of the road
./data/Client2\sample-001642.mp3,don't be impatient he repeated to himself
./data/Client2\sample-001643.mp3,they had gone away to breakfast at henderson's house
./data/Client2\sample-001644.mp3,the desert takes our men from us and they don't always return she said
./data/Client2\sample-001645.mp3,he decided to stay right there and await his return
./data/Client2\sample-001646.mp3,they never found the secret
./data/Client2\sample-001647.mp3,from then on he would make his own decisions
./data/Client2\sample-001648.mp3,one night the father had a dream
./data/Client2\sample-001649.mp3,if good things are coming they will be a pleasant surprise said the seer
./data/Client2\sample-001650.mp3,the owner of the bar came over and looked as well
./data/Client2\sample-001651.mp3,only the lights in the great tent remained
./data/Client2\sample-001652.mp3,don't you know there are nine jobs waiting for this guy
./data/Client2\sample-001653.mp3,few people realise the immensity of vacancy
./data/Client2\sample-001654.mp3,you are wise because you observe everything from a distance the boy said
./data/Client2\sample-001655.mp3,i couldnt stop staring at it
./data/Client2\sample-001656.mp3,we took all the chances
./data/Client2\sample-001657.mp3,ogilvy told him everything that he had seen
./data/Client2\sample-001658.mp3,but they were not there
./data/Client2\sample-001659.mp3,there was surely a baker in her town
./data/Client2\sample-001660.mp3,what do you want done with them tomorrow morning
./data/Client2\sample-001661.mp3,the boy awoke before dawn
./data/Client2\sample-001662.mp3,suddenly a huge quantity of green smoke came out of the pit in three puffs and went straight into the still air
./data/Client2\sample-001663.mp3,he's hardly my mr doyle
./data/Client2\sample-001664.mp3,look at the bottle you took the powder from
./data/Client2\sample-001665.mp3,in a way so am i he said
./data/Client2\sample-001666.mp3,they're starting to throw things
./data/Client2\sample-001667.mp3,the top of the cylinder was rotating on its body
./data/Client2\sample-001668.mp3,the thought was so dreadful to him that he forgot about the heat and went forward
./data/Client2\sample-001669.mp3,i think it's marvelous
./data/Client2\sample-001670.mp3,be less complicated without a family
./data/Client2\sample-001671.mp3,most meteorites are more or less rounded
./data/Client2\sample-001672.mp3,when she called her friend for help with her computer she repeatedly emphasized that she hadn't done anything
./data/Client2\sample-001673.mp3,he was selling better than ever
./data/Client2\sample-001674.mp3,i want those stamps
./data/Client2\sample-001675.mp3,the boy smiled to himself
./data/Client2\sample-001676.mp3,the world speaks many languages the boy thought
./data/Client2\sample-001677.mp3,only when he himself reveals it
./data/Client2\sample-001678.mp3,i'm getting them for twelve dollars a night
./data/Client2\sample-001679.mp3,the morning post is not obstructing justice or hiding criminals
./data/Client2\sample-001680.mp3,all i want to do is be let alone
./data/Client2\sample-001681.mp3,why was it that he wanted the boy to serve as his instrument
./data/Client2\sample-001682.mp3,the sheep had taught him that
./data/Client2\sample-001683.mp3,it wasn't there
./data/Client2\sample-001684.mp3,but his heart was speaking of other things
./data/Client2\sample-001685.mp3,but the alchemist continued to look to the horizon
./data/Client2\sample-001686.mp3,there was no need to imprison them the arabs simply confiscated their horses
./data/Client2\sample-001687.mp3,i have already described the appearance of that colossal bulk which was embedded in the ground
./data/Client2\sample-001688.mp3,it was such a gradual movement that he found it only by noticing the dots
./data/Client2\sample-001689.mp3,all things are one the old man had said
./data/Client2\sample-001690.mp3,looking up he saw a pair of hawks flying high in the sky
./data/Client2\sample-001691.mp3,so then try he said to the englishman
./data/Client2\sample-001692.mp3,she told me she feels hopeful and optimistic
./data/Client2\sample-001693.mp3,the beach looked so beautifully
./data/Client2\sample-001694.mp3,he prepared himself a sandwich and drank some hot tea from a crystal glass
./data/Client2\sample-001695.mp3,one can imagine these two covered with sand running up the little street in the bright sunlight
./data/Client2\sample-001696.mp3,at his side was the young arab the boy had spoken with earlier
./data/Client2\sample-001697.mp3,fifty bucks ain't going to ruin me
./data/Client2\sample-001698.mp3,he ran his fingers slowly over the stones sensing their temperature and feeling their surfaces
./data/Client2\sample-001699.mp3,a frightening concept occured to jennifer
./data/Client2\sample-001700.mp3,we're a different world
./data/Client2\sample-001701.mp3,i heard a peculiar humming sound from the pit
./data/Client2\sample-001702.mp3,the girl dropped the container and the water spilled
./data/Client2\sample-001703.mp3,give it to me
./data/Client2\sample-001704.mp3,you point to a trail of ants leading into the house
./data/Client2\sample-001705.mp3,amy's a genius at research
./data/Client2\sample-001706.mp3,every day was there to be lived or to mark one's departure from this world
./data/Client2\sample-001707.mp3,his hands began to tremble and the woman sensed it
./data/Client2\sample-001708.mp3,i heard a peculiar humming sound from the pit
./data/Client2\sample-001709.mp3,no that's not what i mean
./data/Client2\sample-001710.mp3,but the boy couldn't even speak
./data/Client2\sample-001711.mp3,for a site titled handsfree coding i haven't written much about how to actually write the code
./data/Client2\sample-001712.mp3,there was very little talking
./data/Client2\sample-001713.mp3,all that time the martians must have been getting ready
./data/Client2\sample-001714.mp3,i don't care what you charge them with
./data/Client2\sample-001715.mp3,it all happened rather suddenly
./data/Client2\sample-001716.mp3,everything in the universe evolved he said
./data/Client2\sample-001717.mp3,and i'm certain you'll find it the alchemist said
./data/Client2\sample-001718.mp3,they're not for sale he said
./data/Client2\sample-001719.mp3,i had seen all that it would presently bring me
./data/Client2\sample-001720.mp3,i locked eyes with a fish in the tank
./data/Client2\sample-001721.mp3,but she hadn't charged him anything
./data/Client2\sample-001722.mp3,the wind told me that you know about love the boy said to the sun
./data/Client2\sample-001723.mp3,i didn't say anything
./data/Client2\sample-001724.mp3,her walls were covered with dark and scary sketches
./data/Client2\sample-001725.mp3,an huge hole had been made by the impact of the projectile
./data/Client2\sample-001726.mp3,i want to see that map covered before we get through
./data/Client2\sample-001727.mp3,it was as if it quivered but really this was the telescope vibrating
./data/Client2\sample-001728.mp3,he drew on the back of his jacket with a blue fountain pen
./data/Client2\sample-001729.mp3,they rented a boat and went down the river
./data/Client2\sample-001730.mp3,strange images passed through my mind
./data/Client2\sample-001731.mp3,camels are traitorous they walk thousands of paces and never seem to tire
./data/Client2\sample-001732.mp3,the alchemist dismounted and told the escorts they could return to the camp
./data/Client2\sample-001733.mp3,he got up early with the idea of finding it
./data/Client2\sample-001734.mp3,in one he had read that many years ago a famous arabian alchemist had visited europe
./data/Client2\sample-001735.mp3,they're not my children
./data/Client2\sample-001736.mp3,the silicon sealant has dried
./data/Client2\sample-001737.mp3,taking the jacket out he began to clean the glasses
./data/Client2\sample-001738.mp3,because i've always heard about them the boy answered saying nothing about his dream
./data/Client2\sample-001739.mp3,the cushion was soft and inviting
./data/Client2\sample-001740.mp3,he didn't want to cry with the other people there
./data/Client2\sample-001741.mp3,toward the end of the afternoon they came upon a coptic monastery
./data/Client2\sample-001742.mp3,what could i do
./data/Client2\sample-001743.mp3,what is an alchemist he asked finally
./data/Client2\sample-001744.mp3,i'm gonna get my arm fixed out of this
./data/Client2\sample-001745.mp3,'m all about those invisible cosmic connections that transcend time and distance
./data/Client2\sample-001746.mp3,it was the levanter the wind that came from africa
./data/Client2\sample-001747.mp3,the shop folks were taking down their shutters and people were opening their bedroom windows
./data/Client2\sample-001748.mp3,and he gave you that five dollar raise
./data/Client2\sample-001749.mp3,it was better than the scent of the hookahs
./data/Client2\sample-001750.mp3,i didn't come here to have you read my palm he said already regretting having come
./data/Client2\sample-001751.mp3,a long note was sounded on a bugle and everyone mounted up
./data/Client2\sample-001752.mp3,scattered groups of people were hurrying from the direction of woking
./data/Client2\sample-001753.mp3,the camel driver was not a fighter and he had consulted with seers
./data/Client2\sample-001754.mp3,i've always looked on bessie as my own sister
./data/Client2\sample-001755.mp3,it's like the flight of those two hawks it can't be understood by reason alone
./data/Client2\sample-001756.mp3,just things like that
./data/Client2\sample-001757.mp3,the wind has many names
./data/Client2\sample-001758.mp3,yes or even search for treasure
./data/Client2\sample-001759.mp3,i thought about whether we should find coins and models in it and so on
./data/Client2\sample-001760.mp3,the owner of the bar came over and looked as well
./data/Client2\sample-001761.mp3,there was no respite to be had
./data/Client2\sample-001762.mp3,i shall make us some ice cubes
./data/Client2\sample-001763.mp3,in spite of this i still believed that there were men in mars
./data/Client2\sample-001764.mp3,now what's the story
./data/Client2\sample-001765.mp3,three to two in our favor
./data/Client2\sample-001766.mp3,there was no excuse for goodman to fly off the handle
./data/Client2\sample-001767.mp3,this is a very interesting situation
./data/Client2\sample-001768.mp3,because you are trying to realize your destiny
./data/Client2\sample-001769.mp3,so we their hearts speak more and more softly
./data/Client2\sample-001770.mp3,you were seen at the enemy camp three days ago
./data/Client2\sample-001771.mp3,to save fuel the ariane rocket has been launched not far from the equator
./data/Client2\sample-001772.mp3,let's get out of here said the new arrival
./data/Client2\sample-001773.mp3,he knew nothing about the customs of the strange land he was in
./data/Client2\sample-001774.mp3,the treasure is at the pyramids that you already knew
./data/Client2\sample-001775.mp3,and so despite the fact that he was a roman centurion he converted to their faith
./data/Client2\sample-001776.mp3,some went away while i was there and other people came
./data/Client2\sample-001777.mp3,advancing slowly they searched among the stones
./data/Client2\sample-001778.mp3,everybody knows you're a sweetheart
./data/Client2\sample-001779.mp3,and about you too
./data/Client2\sample-001780.mp3,the boy looked out at the horizon
./data/Client2\sample-001781.mp3,let me comb your hair
./data/Client2\sample-001782.mp3,they are so used to me that they know my schedule he muttered
./data/Client2\sample-001783.mp3,henderson stood up with a spade in his hand
./data/Client2\sample-001784.mp3,and she already has her treasure it's you
./data/Client2\sample-001785.mp3,just as your grandfather taught you
./data/Client2\sample-001786.mp3,the turf and gravel around it seemed charred as if by a sudden explosion
./data/Client2\sample-001787.mp3,what time is it
./data/Client2\sample-001788.mp3,there was a full moon and the boy told the englishman the story of his life
./data/Client2\sample-001789.mp3,the time must have been somewhere around six o'clock
./data/Client2\sample-001790.mp3,the boy had never even noticed that there was a hole in his pouch
./data/Client2\sample-001791.mp3,the war continued and at times the wind carried the sweet sickly smell of blood
./data/Client2\sample-001792.mp3,at once he connected the two incidents
./data/Client2\sample-001793.mp3,but men began to reject simple things and to write tracts interpretations and philosophical studies
./data/Client2\sample-001794.mp3,in spite of this i still believed that there were men in mars
./data/Client2\sample-001795.mp3,it seemed such a little thing so bright and small and still
./data/Client2\sample-001796.mp3,but can we trust him
./data/Client2\sample-001797.mp3,he had used the two stones only once one morning when he was at a marketplace
./data/Client2\sample-001798.mp3,you must always know what it is that you want the old king had said
./data/Client2\sample-001799.mp3,some of our biggest clients are affected
./data/Client2\sample-001800.mp3,as he sat there thinking he sensed movement above him
./data/Client2\sample-001801.mp3,i remember how i sat on the table there in the blackness with patches of green and crimson swimming before my eyes
./data/Client2\sample-001802.mp3,he told fatima that at their next meeting
./data/Client2\sample-001803.mp3,it's gonna put our city on the map
./data/Client2\sample-001804.mp3,henderson stood up with a spade in his hand
./data/Client2\sample-001805.mp3,the londoners regretted visiting this awful place
./data/Client2\sample-001806.mp3,he had already seen many people come and go and the desert remained as it was
./data/Client2\sample-001807.mp3,arabs often appeared in the city shopping and chanting their strange prayers several times a day
./data/Client2\sample-001808.mp3,i'm going to hate those who have found their treasure because i never found mine
./data/Client2\sample-001809.mp3,she ought to be here any minute
./data/Client2\sample-001810.mp3,turkey for thanksgiving
./data/Client2\sample-001811.mp3,many telescopes were pointed at it
./data/Client2\sample-001812.mp3,you should see the other guy specifically how good at fighting he is
./data/Client2\sample-001813.mp3,i've had this shop for thirty years
./data/Client2\sample-001814.mp3,will you excuse us a minute
./data/Client2\sample-001815.mp3,and one or two persons were returning
./data/Client2\sample-001816.mp3,i'm sure i don't know what you're talking about
./data/Client2\sample-001817.mp3,that florescent pink colour is hurting my eyes
./data/Client2\sample-001818.mp3,the loafers and golf caddies were used to hanging out near the railway station
./data/Client2\sample-001819.mp3,before guns were invented armies had to throw bullets at each other and if a bullet touched you you had to sit out until the next war
./data/Client2\sample-001820.mp3,and he hadn't perceived them because he had become accustomed to them
./data/Client2\sample-001821.mp3,i don't know how to explain it
./data/Client2\sample-001822.mp3,it was as if it quivered but really this was the telescope vibrating
./data/Client2\sample-001823.mp3,i have already described the appearance of that colossal bulk which was embedded in the ground
./data/Client2\sample-001824.mp3,but you are in the desert
./data/Client2\sample-001825.mp3,my seven year resume gap is marked not drugs
./data/Client2\sample-001826.mp3,the tractor was bearing down hard
./data/Client2\sample-001827.mp3,i found a little crowd of about twenty people surrounding the huge hole
./data/Client2\sample-001828.mp3,the nearby city of ceuta had grown faster than tangier and business had fallen off
./data/Client2\sample-001829.mp3,it was difficult not to think about what he had left behind
./data/Client2\sample-001830.mp3,but the king of salem hoped desperately that the boy would be successful
./data/Client2\sample-001831.mp3,and he knew that egypt was in africa
./data/Client2\sample-001832.mp3,all this happened between sunrise and sunset the boy thought
./data/Client2\sample-001833.mp3,well he thought about that the old man said
./data/Client2\sample-001834.mp3,don't you remember the home i promised you
./data/Client2\sample-001835.mp3,the plastic barrier shattered
./data/Client2\sample-001836.mp3,the monk was irritated
./data/Client2\sample-001837.mp3,but now the sounds inside had stopped
./data/Client2\sample-001838.mp3,and then he would ask us to go back to our easels and replicate all the techniques in one go
./data/Client2\sample-001839.mp3,a large piece suddenly came off and fell with a loud and sharp noise
./data/Client2\sample-001840.mp3,you're just the one i wanted to see
./data/Client2\sample-001841.mp3,i'm getting married tomorrow
./data/Client2\sample-001842.mp3,the horizon was tinged with red and suddenly the sun appeared
./data/Client2\sample-001843.mp3,the boy had never even noticed that there was a hole in his pouch
./data/Client2\sample-001844.mp3,air was either entering or escaping at the rim with a thin sizzling sound
./data/Client2\sample-001845.mp3,but everything that happens twice will surely happen a third time
./data/Client2\sample-001846.mp3,he sat looking at the sky for a long time
./data/Client2\sample-001847.mp3,because i've always heard about them the boy answered saying nothing about his dream
./data/Client2\sample-001848.mp3,maybe tomorrow said the boy moving away
./data/Client2\sample-001849.mp3,and the alchemist understood that the boy's heart had returned to the soul of the world
./data/Client2\sample-001850.mp3,there was a hole there among the stones
./data/Client2\sample-001851.mp3,the last time she came in here
./data/Client2\sample-001852.mp3,but there's a tribal war the boy reiterated
./data/Client2\sample-001853.mp3,now im scared of what is inside of pies
./data/Client2\sample-001854.mp3,people say strange things the boy thought
./data/Client2\sample-001855.mp3,in a way so am i he said
./data/Client2\sample-001856.mp3,he thought of the merchant's daughter and was sure that she had probably married
./data/Client2\sample-001857.mp3,but a lovely chap
./data/Client2\sample-001858.mp3,the immense collection of people and animals began to travel faster
./data/Client2\sample-001859.mp3,the desert was all sand in some stretches and rocky in others
./data/Client2\sample-001860.mp3,the canadian people are a little too humble
./data/Client2\sample-001861.mp3,it's not a battle of good against evil
./data/Client2\sample-001862.mp3,the shepherd said nothing
./data/Client2\sample-001863.mp3,how much do you want on it
./data/Client2\sample-001864.mp3,if i could i'd write a huge encyclopedia just about the words luck and coincidence
./data/Client2\sample-001865.mp3,ogilvy watched till one and then gave up
./data/Client2\sample-001866.mp3,the pat anthony party
./data/Client2\sample-001867.mp3,people should spend time on improving opensource projects instead of helping market dominating companies
./data/Client2\sample-001868.mp3,'and this is what your son said' the angel told the man
./data/Client2\sample-001869.mp3,no one can be from many places the boy said
./data/Client2\sample-001870.mp3,the thief wasn't there and the owner brought him a cup of tea
./data/Client2\sample-001871.mp3,i found myself alone and saw the people on the other side of the pit running away
./data/Client2\sample-001872.mp3,there are a couple ways to improve on this
./data/Client2\sample-001873.mp3,i've got a flash for you
./data/Client2\sample-001874.mp3,those gangsters get what they deserve
./data/Client2\sample-001875.mp3,the shepherd swore that he would
./data/Client2\sample-001876.mp3,as he was attempting to pull out the rocks he encountered he heard footsteps
./data/Client2\sample-001877.mp3,the woman was silent for some time
./data/Client2\sample-001878.mp3,few people realise the immensity of vacancy
./data/Client2\sample-001879.mp3,maybe tomorrow will be better than yesterday
./data/Client2\sample-001880.mp3,he lives at the alfayoum oasis his friend had said
./data/Client2\sample-001881.mp3,he told fatima that at their next meeting
./data/Client2\sample-001882.mp3,but they were not there
./data/Client2\sample-001883.mp3,what are you doing tonight
./data/Client2\sample-001884.mp3,he knew all the fields and pastures of andalusia
./data/Client2\sample-001885.mp3,she loves to read but is unsure how reading is helping her become more creative
./data/Client2\sample-001886.mp3,i noticed that the boy answered
./data/Client2\sample-001887.mp3,this man looked exactly the same except that now the roles were reversed
./data/Client2\sample-001888.mp3,the first rule of don't fight club is let's talk about it
./data/Client2\sample-001889.mp3,the burning fire had been extinguished
./data/Client2\sample-001890.mp3,alchemy is a serious discipline
./data/Client2\sample-001891.mp3,what had been next to him five minutes ago was now at the other side
./data/Client2\sample-001892.mp3,your government is counting on you
./data/Client2\sample-001893.mp3,and she already has her treasure it's you
./data/Client2\sample-001894.mp3,remember the night we broke the windows in this old house
./data/Client2\sample-001895.mp3,the reprieve for george
./data/Client2\sample-001896.mp3,you point to a trail of ants leading into the house
./data/Client2\sample-001897.mp3,don't say that again
./data/Client2\sample-001898.mp3,there is only one way to learn the alchemist answered
./data/Client2\sample-001899.mp3,and what do you do in salem he insisted
./data/Client2\sample-001900.mp3,they were tribesmen dressed in blue with black rings surrounding their turbans
./data/Client2\sample-001901.mp3,the heather was on fire and you could see a thin blue smoke rising up slowly
./data/Client2\sample-001902.mp3,the loafers and golf caddies were used to hanging out near the railway station
./data/Client2\sample-001903.mp3,they set off running wildly into the trees
./data/Client2\sample-001904.mp3,one can imagine these two covered with sand running up the little street in the bright sunlight
./data/Client2\sample-001905.mp3,the boy didn't know what to say
./data/Client2\sample-001906.mp3,my seven year resume gap is marked not drugs
./data/Client2\sample-001907.mp3,so he could not be hasty nor impatient
./data/Client2\sample-001908.mp3,the next day the boy returned to the well hoping to see the girl
./data/Client2\sample-001909.mp3,at the highest point in tarifa there is an old fort built by the moors
./data/Client2\sample-001910.mp3,and it's not love to see everything from a distance like you do
./data/Client2\sample-001911.mp3,the boy was embarrassed and confessed that he had observed nothing
./data/Client2\sample-001912.mp3,i was disappointed at this inanimate bulk
./data/Client2\sample-001913.mp3,that's why i'm quitting
./data/Client2\sample-001914.mp3,i went stretching my legs clumsily and feeling my way in the dark
./data/Client2\sample-001915.mp3,fill this place with a sandstorm so strong that it blots out the sun
./data/Client2\sample-001916.mp3,my mind ran on the possibilities of its content
./data/Client2\sample-001917.mp3,henderson was taking it in
./data/Client2\sample-001918.mp3,i've been trying to get her to come to
./data/Client2\sample-001919.mp3,and he told what he had seen
./data/Client2\sample-001920.mp3,hundreds must have seen it and taken it for a falling star
./data/Client2\sample-001921.mp3,i have been waiting for her to respond for two days now so i just went ahead and did it for her
./data/Client2\sample-001922.mp3,there was a hole there among the stones
./data/Client2\sample-001923.mp3,my mind ran on the possibilities of its content
./data/Client2\sample-001924.mp3,the company's stock value increased dramatically after they found a new medicine
./data/Client2\sample-001925.mp3,no doubt the impact had caused a flash of fire
./data/Client2\sample-001926.mp3,enough said the boy
./data/Client2\sample-001927.mp3,i just don't trust anyone who says they've never had hamburger helper
./data/Client2\sample-001928.mp3,i had the everyone has gary busey's teeth dream again
./data/Client2\sample-001929.mp3,you must always know what it is that you want the old king had said
./data/Client2\sample-001930.mp3,the invaders carried the name everywhere the beautiful girl spoke of the invaders with pride
./data/Client2\sample-001931.mp3,the thought was so dreadful to him that he forgot about the heat and went forward
./data/Client2\sample-001932.mp3,the top had certainly ceased to rotate
./data/Client2\sample-001933.mp3,did she ever marry the girl
./data/Client2\sample-001934.mp3,the thought was so dreadful to him that he forgot about the heat and went forward
./data/Client2\sample-001935.mp3,and he wasn't faring much better
./data/Client2\sample-001936.mp3,i've got to go to him
./data/Client2\sample-001937.mp3,because we're the people and we're tough
./data/Client2\sample-001938.mp3,thousands of people die every year as a consequence of air pollution
./data/Client2\sample-001939.mp3,feller runs the february months
./data/Client2\sample-001940.mp3,will you come here
./data/Client2\sample-001941.mp3,the old man knew how to read and had already read the book
./data/Client2\sample-001942.mp3,i'm looking for a treasure said the boy and he immediately regretted having said it
./data/Client2\sample-001943.mp3,they'll never close us up today
./data/Client2\sample-001944.mp3,he must know how to deal with the snakes of the desert
./data/Client2\sample-001945.mp3,you certainly delivered the goods
./data/Client2\sample-001946.mp3,no doubt the impact had caused a flash of fire
./data/Client2\sample-001947.mp3,i wished i had a light to smoke by
./data/Client2\sample-001948.mp3,all i say is spit them out
./data/Client2\sample-001949.mp3,what's the fifth obligation the boy asked
./data/Client2\sample-001950.mp3,when he saw henderson in his garden he called over the fence and made himself understood
./data/Client2\sample-001951.mp3,the crowd swayed a little as i elbowed my way through
./data/Client2\sample-001952.mp3,a boy came running towards me
./data/Client2\sample-001953.mp3,the usb device didn't function correctly
./data/Client2\sample-001954.mp3,we're a different world
./data/Client2\sample-001955.mp3,you must love the desert but never trust it completely
./data/Client2\sample-001956.mp3,he was immensely excited at the news
./data/Client2\sample-001957.mp3,he must be disguised to avoid encounters with thieves
./data/Client2\sample-001958.mp3,it was as if it quivered but really this was the telescope vibrating
./data/Client2\sample-001959.mp3,why does melissandre look like she wants to consume jon snow on the ride up the wall
./data/Client2\sample-001960.mp3,why do they make things so complicated he asked the englishman one night
./data/Client2\sample-001961.mp3,he didn't want his hand to begin trembling showing the old woman that he was fearful
./data/Client2\sample-001962.mp3,the sun was turned into a golden disk
./data/Client2\sample-001963.mp3,with this kind of organization i find it's much easier to prioritize within a category
./data/Client2\sample-001964.mp3,that first day everyone slept from exhaustion including the englishman
./data/Client2\sample-001965.mp3,we lit the lantern and walked over to his house
./data/Client2\sample-001966.mp3,i'm never more aware of a room's acoustics than when i'm trying to enjoy a snack i have no intention of sharing
./data/Client2\sample-001967.mp3,don't you push me around like that
./data/Client2\sample-001968.mp3,the homeless seem to like soup
./data/Client2\sample-001969.mp3,i am following my destiny
./data/Client2\sample-001970.mp3,i was scared but wasted no time in going out and crossing the bridge to the sand pits
./data/Client2\sample-001971.mp3,all that time the martians must have been getting ready
./data/Client2\sample-001972.mp3,his name is welch
./data/Client2\sample-001973.mp3,just a memory right now it signified shade water and a refuge from the war
./data/Client2\sample-001974.mp3,i'd like you to take me there if you can
./data/Client2\sample-001975.mp3,about eleven i walked back to my home in maybury because nothing seemed to be happening
./data/Client2\sample-001976.mp3,and the nightgown had changed into a beautiful wedding gown
./data/Client2\sample-001977.mp3,nobody wanted to discuss how we all ended up trapped in a giant lunchbox
./data/Client2\sample-001978.mp3,this is the first phase of the job he said
./data/Client2\sample-001979.mp3,you just pat him
./data/Client2\sample-001980.mp3,that was until the site was blocked
./data/Client2\sample-001981.mp3,turning the air conditioning on leads to an increased fuel consumption
./data/Client2\sample-001982.mp3,we'll have something to drink and eat these hawks
./data/Client2\sample-001983.mp3,are you crazy the boy asked the alchemist when they had moved on
./data/Client2\sample-001984.mp3,why a revolver he asked
./data/Client2\sample-001985.mp3,will you help me
./data/Client2\sample-001986.mp3,this time we're going to get it right
./data/Client2\sample-001987.mp3,that guy over there likes to drink a lot talk a lot but do nothing
./data/Client2\sample-001988.mp3,he asked for him
./data/Client2\sample-001989.mp3,i had the everyone has gary busey's teeth dream again
./data/Client2\sample-001990.mp3,the wind began to blow again
./data/Client2\sample-001991.mp3,it's not a battle of good against evil
./data/Client2\sample-001992.mp3,they shouted consolation and promises and went off back to the town again to get help
./data/Client2\sample-001993.mp3,excuse you for what
./data/Client2\sample-001994.mp3,a poor little fellow that never meant nobody no harm
./data/Client2\sample-001995.mp3,will you try to get some sleep
./data/Client2\sample-001996.mp3,you may not have a great deal of time
./data/Client2\sample-001997.mp3,he approached the mass and was surprised at the size and the shape
./data/Client2\sample-001998.mp3,i ain't gonna squeal
./data/Client2\sample-001999.mp3,and that's where the power of love comes in
