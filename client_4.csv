./data/Client4\sample-003002.mp3,i heard a faint movement under my feet
./data/Client4\sample-003003.mp3,as the astronaut walked into the translucent pod it transformed into an opaque material
./data/Client4\sample-003004.mp3,because you are trying to realize your destiny
./data/Client4\sample-003005.mp3,how long is it
./data/Client4\sample-003006.mp3,she'll see us through dinner
./data/Client4\sample-003007.mp3,camels are traitorous they walk thousands of paces and never seem to tire
./data/Client4\sample-003008.mp3,the boy remembered an old proverb from his country
./data/Client4\sample-003009.mp3,i swear it on my mother's grave
./data/Client4\sample-003010.mp3,how'd you get in here
./data/Client4\sample-003011.mp3,so they think she left it with you
./data/Client4\sample-003012.mp3,that hole in the wall was too small for him to fit through
./data/Client4\sample-003013.mp3,nice to meet you
./data/Client4\sample-003014.mp3,wear the blue one
./data/Client4\sample-003015.mp3,the englishman was unable to sleep one night
./data/Client4\sample-003016.mp3,i don't think it's very ethical reading other people's stuff
./data/Client4\sample-003017.mp3,henderson stood up with a spade in his hand
./data/Client4\sample-003018.mp3,i don't know how to explain it
./data/Client4\sample-003019.mp3,toronto is a few miles away
./data/Client4\sample-003020.mp3,when the lead had become liquid the alchemist took from his pouch the strange yellow egg
./data/Client4\sample-003021.mp3,i have to separate out the sulfur
./data/Client4\sample-003022.mp3,the octopus worried the squid
./data/Client4\sample-003023.mp3,did you want to see her about something important
./data/Client4\sample-003024.mp3,he looked like an arab which was not unusual in those parts
./data/Client4\sample-003025.mp3,'everyone loved them and enjoyed them
./data/Client4\sample-003026.mp3,i don't know why you boys are so good to me
./data/Client4\sample-003027.mp3,hires two personal trainers and make one of them train the other one
./data/Client4\sample-003028.mp3,we need to solve this problem fast
./data/Client4\sample-003029.mp3,if you want it you must take it
./data/Client4\sample-003030.mp3,i don't want to rush you
./data/Client4\sample-003031.mp3,that's the man who knows all the secrets of the world she said
./data/Client4\sample-003032.mp3,that's the point at which most people give up
./data/Client4\sample-003033.mp3,he decided to spend the night there
./data/Client4\sample-003034.mp3,an alchemist said the alchemist
./data/Client4\sample-003035.mp3,besides that there was a heap of bicycles
./data/Client4\sample-003036.mp3,the thing itself was almost entirely buried in sand
./data/Client4\sample-003037.mp3,i'm not afraid of failing
./data/Client4\sample-003038.mp3,do you want to go to work for me the merchant asked
./data/Client4\sample-003039.mp3,what do you know about it
./data/Client4\sample-003040.mp3,he decided to spend the night there
./data/Client4\sample-003041.mp3,upon returning to the wise man he related in detail everything he had seen
./data/Client4\sample-003042.mp3,i'm playing for keeps
./data/Client4\sample-003043.mp3,i'll work for you he said
./data/Client4\sample-003044.mp3,i can't think of any reason why she was killed
./data/Client4\sample-003045.mp3,no sense messing up the streets
./data/Client4\sample-003046.mp3,the falcon's beak carries bits of me myself the desert said
./data/Client4\sample-003047.mp3,the streamer of gas came out towards us
./data/Client4\sample-003048.mp3,the girl dropped the container and the water spilled
./data/Client4\sample-003049.mp3,you point to a trail of ants leading into the house
./data/Client4\sample-003050.mp3,the cringe levels were almost unbearable
./data/Client4\sample-003051.mp3,when playing children often just reenact what they experienced before
./data/Client4\sample-003052.mp3,the hunter was alerted by the sound of rustling vegetation behind her
./data/Client4\sample-003053.mp3,i was wondering if you could tell me a bit more about what it's like to live and work there
./data/Client4\sample-003054.mp3,did you see the garden that it took the master gardener ten years to create
./data/Client4\sample-003055.mp3,but when the reign of tiberius ended his poems were forgotten
./data/Client4\sample-003056.mp3,you can't believe it's not butter
./data/Client4\sample-003057.mp3,scattered groups of people were hurrying from the direction of woking
./data/Client4\sample-003058.mp3,and they attacked an empty tent
./data/Client4\sample-003059.mp3,what was written on the emerald tablet the boy wanted to know
./data/Client4\sample-003060.mp3,the alchemist followed as the boy's horse ran for almost half an hour
./data/Client4\sample-003061.mp3,dee's house right now
./data/Client4\sample-003062.mp3,but i sort of like him
./data/Client4\sample-003063.mp3,but i'm going to egypt the boy said
./data/Client4\sample-003064.mp3,then you'll die in the midst of trying to realize your destiny
./data/Client4\sample-003065.mp3,he dressed in his arabian clothing of white linen bought especially for this day
./data/Client4\sample-003066.mp3,the wind began to blow again
./data/Client4\sample-003067.mp3,the vertex was out of alignment
./data/Client4\sample-003068.mp3,a friend had told the boy about the shop and he had taken his sheep there
./data/Client4\sample-003069.mp3,the stranger was speaking of things that very few people knew about
./data/Client4\sample-003070.mp3,i heard what you were talking about the other day with the alchemist the wind said
./data/Client4\sample-003071.mp3,he moved about invisible but everyone could hear him
./data/Client4\sample-003072.mp3,it was such a gradual movement that he found it only by noticing the dots
./data/Client4\sample-003073.mp3,many telescopes were pointed at it
./data/Client4\sample-003074.mp3,from that day on it was the desert that would be important
./data/Client4\sample-003075.mp3,he had no idea how he was going to transform himself into the wind
./data/Client4\sample-003076.mp3,many telescopes were pointed at it
./data/Client4\sample-003077.mp3,the englishman could not contain his excitement
./data/Client4\sample-003078.mp3,the whole police force standing on it's ear
./data/Client4\sample-003079.mp3,and the solid part was called the philosopher's stone
./data/Client4\sample-003080.mp3,then use some other method for clicking or activating the item you're looking at
./data/Client4\sample-003081.mp3,the men fell into an animated discussion
./data/Client4\sample-003082.mp3,the invaders carried the name everywhere the beautiful girl spoke of the invaders with pride
./data/Client4\sample-003083.mp3,i'll just watch him he said to himself
./data/Client4\sample-003084.mp3,the two walked out among the palms
./data/Client4\sample-003085.mp3,his heart squeezed as if his chest had suddenly compressed it
./data/Client4\sample-003086.mp3,i didn't want to marry anybody else in town
./data/Client4\sample-003087.mp3,no doubt the impact had caused a flash of fire
./data/Client4\sample-003088.mp3,i found a little crowd of about twenty people surrounding the huge hole
./data/Client4\sample-003089.mp3,you bet i will
./data/Client4\sample-003090.mp3,the space station rocked violently due to the intense pressure wave from the airlock failure
./data/Client4\sample-003091.mp3,do you like it
./data/Client4\sample-003092.mp3,the camel drivers exchanged information about windstorms and told stories about the desert
./data/Client4\sample-003093.mp3,cassie dismantled the bicycle
./data/Client4\sample-003094.mp3,this is for you he said holding one of the parts out to the monk
./data/Client4\sample-003095.mp3,life attracts life the alchemist answered
./data/Client4\sample-003096.mp3,there were raised voicesand some sort of struggle appeared to be going on 
./data/Client4\sample-003097.mp3,'m all about those invisible cosmic connections that transcend time and distance
./data/Client4\sample-003098.mp3,christine valued her freedom and would never deny anyone that privilege
./data/Client4\sample-003099.mp3,the land was ruined and i had to find some other way to earn a living
./data/Client4\sample-003100.mp3,let him have everything he wants
./data/Client4\sample-003101.mp3,you dominated those horsemen with the way you looked at them he said
./data/Client4\sample-003102.mp3,the shepherd said nothing
./data/Client4\sample-003103.mp3,i'm going to need it
./data/Client4\sample-003104.mp3,the boy became fearful the omens told him that something was wrong
./data/Client4\sample-003105.mp3,in biology we study plants and animals in their natural environment
./data/Client4\sample-003106.mp3,sadly my dream of becoming a squirrel whisperer may never happen
./data/Client4\sample-003107.mp3,from there he could see africa in the distance
./data/Client4\sample-003108.mp3,the thought was so dreadful to him that he forgot about the heat and went forward
./data/Client4\sample-003109.mp3,i was scared but wasted no time in going out and crossing the bridge to the sand pits
./data/Client4\sample-003110.mp3,the tradition teaches men how to cross the desert and how their children should marry
./data/Client4\sample-003111.mp3,and the girl pointed to the south indicating that it was there the strange man lived
./data/Client4\sample-003112.mp3,they must be used to their new shepherd and have probably already forgotten me
./data/Client4\sample-003113.mp3,i thought sure you'd remember me
./data/Client4\sample-003114.mp3,there's a place to sit down
./data/Client4\sample-003115.mp3,it was only when i got this close to it that the strangeness of it was at all evident to me
./data/Client4\sample-003116.mp3,i admit that i'm an alcoholic
./data/Client4\sample-003117.mp3,an huge hole had been made by the impact of the projectile
./data/Client4\sample-003118.mp3,i'm an old superstitious arab and i believe in our proverbs
./data/Client4\sample-003119.mp3,i've actually fallen in love with him
./data/Client4\sample-003120.mp3,you can't go any farther one of them said
./data/Client4\sample-003121.mp3,i'm doing much better and soon you'll be able to return to your sheep
./data/Client4\sample-003122.mp3,we have recovered most of the deleted files but some are still being processed
./data/Client4\sample-003123.mp3,after the accident his bicycle had to be repaired
./data/Client4\sample-003124.mp3,he came to understand its dodges and tricks and to accept it as it was
./data/Client4\sample-003125.mp3,and the alchemist understood that the boy's heart had returned to the soul of the world
./data/Client4\sample-003126.mp3,at night they spread their sleeping gear and kept their fires hidden
./data/Client4\sample-003127.mp3,this is the morning post you're talking to
./data/Client4\sample-003128.mp3,as if i had the money back in a safe
./data/Client4\sample-003129.mp3,and then they want the person to change
./data/Client4\sample-003130.mp3,sometimes it's better to be with the sheep who don't say anything
./data/Client4\sample-003131.mp3,the boy didn't know what to say
./data/Client4\sample-003132.mp3,i bet you she'd know how to say it all right
./data/Client4\sample-003133.mp3,i still can't understand it though
./data/Client4\sample-003134.mp3,and he gave the boy his blessing
./data/Client4\sample-003135.mp3,but they could never have taught him arabic
./data/Client4\sample-003136.mp3,you point to a trail of ants leading into the house
./data/Client4\sample-003137.mp3,he understands the forces of nature
./data/Client4\sample-003138.mp3,she cried for an hour
./data/Client4\sample-003139.mp3,i want to tell you a story about dreams said the alchemist
./data/Client4\sample-003140.mp3,we dont want him
./data/Client4\sample-003141.mp3,what're you trying to do
./data/Client4\sample-003142.mp3,gypsies are experts at getting people to do that sighed the old man
./data/Client4\sample-003143.mp3,your account's still here
./data/Client4\sample-003144.mp3,he really was a king
./data/Client4\sample-003145.mp3,that night there was another jetting out of gas from the distant planet
./data/Client4\sample-003146.mp3,i thought that someday i'd be rich and could go to mecca
./data/Client4\sample-003147.mp3,the boy stood up shakily and looked once more at the pyramids
./data/Client4\sample-003148.mp3,the idea is still good
./data/Client4\sample-003149.mp3,april cuddled her lamb
./data/Client4\sample-003150.mp3,rest well tonight as if you were a warrior preparing for combat
./data/Client4\sample-003151.mp3,they're not worth much the englishman answered
./data/Client4\sample-003152.mp3,we're not allowed to tell
./data/Client4\sample-003153.mp3,we're just slowly plodding through some user interviews at the moment
./data/Client4\sample-003154.mp3,now i'm beginning what i could have started ten years ago
./data/Client4\sample-003155.mp3,they are not really friends they just work together and talk from time to time
./data/Client4\sample-003156.mp3,the proposed approach provides stateoftheart results at very low computational cost
./data/Client4\sample-003157.mp3,the first rule of don't fight club is let's talk about it
./data/Client4\sample-003158.mp3,albert didn't have a brother
./data/Client4\sample-003159.mp3,you and i aren't like hassan that rich merchant
./data/Client4\sample-003160.mp3,but he had to move on
./data/Client4\sample-003161.mp3,come on in the office here
./data/Client4\sample-003162.mp3,there were lights in the upper windows of the houses when the people went to bed
./data/Client4\sample-003163.mp3,the wind's curiosity was aroused something that had never happened before
./data/Client4\sample-003164.mp3,the horse reared again raising a cloud of dust
./data/Client4\sample-003165.mp3,people talk a lot about omens thought the shepherd
./data/Client4\sample-003166.mp3,and so will you
./data/Client4\sample-003167.mp3,he stood irresolute for a moment and then scrambled out of the pit
./data/Client4\sample-003168.mp3,but use them to buy your flock
./data/Client4\sample-003169.mp3,maktub thought the boy
./data/Client4\sample-003170.mp3,i've already had that experience with my sheep and now it's happening with people
./data/Client4\sample-003171.mp3,it could be computed in many ways which would give more or less equivalent results
./data/Client4\sample-003172.mp3,the insurance was sky high
./data/Client4\sample-003173.mp3,i don't like seals anyhow
./data/Client4\sample-003174.mp3,when he was a child that man wanted to travel too
./data/Client4\sample-003175.mp3,the old man returned the book to the boy
./data/Client4\sample-003176.mp3,replace the ts in tim tebow's name with any other consonant to get a star wars character
./data/Client4\sample-003177.mp3,do you know what's wrong with you
./data/Client4\sample-003178.mp3,like eating or sleeping or like seeking love or finding a job
./data/Client4\sample-003179.mp3,you have to cross the entire sahara desert said the young man
./data/Client4\sample-003180.mp3,nobody's trying to put anything over on you
./data/Client4\sample-003181.mp3,then the old man began to inspect the sheep and he saw that one was lame
./data/Client4\sample-003182.mp3,there was no justification provided
./data/Client4\sample-003183.mp3,the crowd on the far left seemed to get bigger and i heard now a faint murmur from it
./data/Client4\sample-003184.mp3,night fell and an assortment of fighting men and merchants entered and exited the tent
./data/Client4\sample-003185.mp3,the thing itself was almost entirely buried in sand
./data/Client4\sample-003186.mp3,but they really don't know what they're saying
./data/Client4\sample-003187.mp3,but he decided to take a chance
./data/Client4\sample-003188.mp3,i've heard her speak of you
./data/Client4\sample-003189.mp3,one afternoon they passed by the encampment of one of the tribes
./data/Client4\sample-003190.mp3,what good is money to you if you're going to die
./data/Client4\sample-003191.mp3,i pointed out mars a bright dot of light
./data/Client4\sample-003192.mp3,they made the boy continue digging but he found nothing
./data/Client4\sample-003193.mp3,the old man returned the book to the boy
./data/Client4\sample-003194.mp3,the same book that taught me about urim and thummim
./data/Client4\sample-003195.mp3,of course it is
./data/Client4\sample-003196.mp3,the merchant looked anxiously at the boy
./data/Client4\sample-003197.mp3,a ghostly figure appeared
./data/Client4\sample-003198.mp3,there was a loud shriek from a woman standing behind us
./data/Client4\sample-003199.mp3,for some reason we were blocked from entering
./data/Client4\sample-003200.mp3,you can't believe it's not butter
./data/Client4\sample-003201.mp3,the queen sampled the selection of cakes
./data/Client4\sample-003202.mp3,the fine manufacturing company was a bookkeeper for fourteen years
./data/Client4\sample-003203.mp3,why didn't you tell me
./data/Client4\sample-003204.mp3,they're closing in on you
./data/Client4\sample-003205.mp3,at most they thought that another meteorite had descended
./data/Client4\sample-003206.mp3,the alchemist is two hundred years old the englishman had told him
./data/Client4\sample-003207.mp3,the sheep will get used to my not being there too the boy thought
./data/Client4\sample-003208.mp3,they provided warnings about thieves and barbarian tribes
./data/Client4\sample-003209.mp3,he understands the forces of nature
./data/Client4\sample-003210.mp3,or a man into the wind
./data/Client4\sample-003211.mp3,it reminded him of the wool from his sheep
./data/Client4\sample-003212.mp3,on the  o'clock train
./data/Client4\sample-003213.mp3,the first rule of don't fight club is let's talk about it
./data/Client4\sample-003214.mp3,maybe the alchemist has never been in love the boy thought
./data/Client4\sample-003215.mp3,it may be the gases of the firing that caused the martians inconvenience
./data/Client4\sample-003216.mp3,it's called the principle of favorability
./data/Client4\sample-003217.mp3,i myself heard nothing of that
./data/Client4\sample-003218.mp3,the boy wanted to believe that his friend had simply become separated from him by accident
./data/Client4\sample-003219.mp3,berlin can be so lovely this time of year
./data/Client4\sample-003220.mp3,i came to tell you just one thing the boy said
./data/Client4\sample-003221.mp3,he's doing it because it's what he wants to do
./data/Client4\sample-003222.mp3,he didn't know the man yet but his practiced eye would recognize him when he appeared
./data/Client4\sample-003223.mp3,i have had the same dream twice he said
./data/Client4\sample-003224.mp3,i got a lot on my mind
./data/Client4\sample-003225.mp3,look what the chronicle is running on laura ben
./data/Client4\sample-003226.mp3,suddenly for no apparent reason the boy's horse began to slow
./data/Client4\sample-003227.mp3,this convention is a natural
./data/Client4\sample-003228.mp3,our merchants bought that man and brought him to egypt
./data/Client4\sample-003229.mp3,i'm not working for any other paper
./data/Client4\sample-003230.mp3,from then on he would make his own decisions
./data/Client4\sample-003231.mp3,then came the night of the first falling star
./data/Client4\sample-003232.mp3,the newspaper articles had prepared everyone for the reception of the idea
./data/Client4\sample-003233.mp3,so what is salem like he asked trying to get some sort of clue
./data/Client4\sample-003234.mp3,are you sure erik has our telephone number
./data/Client4\sample-003235.mp3,looks like she can keep kathy's on her toes
./data/Client4\sample-003236.mp3,what happened to your wings
./data/Client4\sample-003237.mp3,it had a diameter of about thirty yards
./data/Client4\sample-003238.mp3,everything in life is an omen said the englishman now closing the journal he was reading
./data/Client4\sample-003239.mp3,then i don't get paid
./data/Client4\sample-003240.mp3,but i found it difficult to get to work because of the investigations
./data/Client4\sample-003241.mp3,most people there take it out pretty early in life
./data/Client4\sample-003242.mp3,the big charleston contest
./data/Client4\sample-003243.mp3,looking through the telescope i saw a circle of deep blue and the little round planet
./data/Client4\sample-003244.mp3,you just don't know all that you've done
./data/Client4\sample-003245.mp3,he told fatima that at their next meeting
./data/Client4\sample-003246.mp3,the closer he got to the realization of his dream the more difficult things became
./data/Client4\sample-003247.mp3,hundreds of observers saw the flame that night and the night after
./data/Client4\sample-003248.mp3,i went swimming with dolphins yesterday
./data/Client4\sample-003249.mp3,but the alchemist continued to look to the horizon
./data/Client4\sample-003250.mp3,dense clouds of smoke or dust can be seen through a powerful telescope
./data/Client4\sample-003251.mp3,he stood irresolute for a moment and then scrambled out of the pit
./data/Client4\sample-003252.mp3,what was written on the emerald tablet the boy wanted to know
./data/Client4\sample-003253.mp3,i'll find out everything
./data/Client4\sample-003254.mp3,you don't have to be rich skinny popular or even own a cape to perform a random act of kindness
./data/Client4\sample-003255.mp3,the boy was getting irritated
./data/Client4\sample-003256.mp3,he spent the entire morning observing the infrequent comings and goings in the street
./data/Client4\sample-003257.mp3,after all who doesnt want to overcome new challenges and achieve great heights
./data/Client4\sample-003258.mp3,no one attacks an oasis
./data/Client4\sample-003259.mp3,looking up he saw a pair of hawks flying high in the sky
./data/Client4\sample-003260.mp3,your account's still here
./data/Client4\sample-003261.mp3,i don't know why we don't all have pneumonia
./data/Client4\sample-003262.mp3,coming home a party of tourists passed us singing and playing music
./data/Client4\sample-003263.mp3,i'd like to have my robe
./data/Client4\sample-003264.mp3,sidelights on sheriff hartman's manhunt
./data/Client4\sample-003265.mp3,the top of the cylinder was rotating on its body
./data/Client4\sample-003266.mp3,about an hour ago
./data/Client4\sample-003267.mp3,she could still be alive
./data/Client4\sample-003268.mp3,then suddenly he noticed it with a start
./data/Client4\sample-003269.mp3,but here's the funniest part of it all
./data/Client4\sample-003270.mp3,few people realise the immensity of vacancy
./data/Client4\sample-003271.mp3,the boy preferred wine
./data/Client4\sample-003272.mp3,it brought his heart into his mouth
./data/Client4\sample-003273.mp3,i want my wife
./data/Client4\sample-003274.mp3,just leave your card with the boy
./data/Client4\sample-003275.mp3,the sun thought for a minute
./data/Client4\sample-003276.mp3,she bought cucumbers at the marketplace
./data/Client4\sample-003277.mp3,the crowd swayed a little as i elbowed my way through
./data/Client4\sample-003278.mp3,scattered groups of people were hurrying from the direction of woking
./data/Client4\sample-003279.mp3,you don't deny that
./data/Client4\sample-003280.mp3,i've just misplaced eight thousand dollars
./data/Client4\sample-003281.mp3,they called that discovery the master work  it was part liquid and part solid
./data/Client4\sample-003282.mp3,the boy listened quietly
./data/Client4\sample-003283.mp3,it's easy and yet i've never done it before he thought
./data/Client4\sample-003284.mp3,is there a crowd in the street
./data/Client4\sample-003285.mp3,we're looking at it right now
./data/Client4\sample-003286.mp3,but all she really ever wanted was a home
./data/Client4\sample-003287.mp3,he sat on a stone and allowed himself to become hypnotized by the horizon
./data/Client4\sample-003288.mp3,i guess you must think i'm kinda batty
./data/Client4\sample-003289.mp3,as the flag unfurled they all hollered like wild beasts
./data/Client4\sample-003290.mp3,let's have a look at the standard deviation
./data/Client4\sample-003291.mp3,henderson stood up with a spade in his hand
./data/Client4\sample-003292.mp3,that night there was another jetting out of gas from the distant planet
./data/Client4\sample-003293.mp3,bert the cop was wounded in north africa
./data/Client4\sample-003294.mp3,noone knows what's behind this gate
./data/Client4\sample-003295.mp3,i'll give it a drink
./data/Client4\sample-003296.mp3,of course it is
./data/Client4\sample-003297.mp3,why don't you have your friends join us
./data/Client4\sample-003298.mp3,i'll see you after
./data/Client4\sample-003299.mp3,well i'd like to see their land and see how they live said his son
./data/Client4\sample-003300.mp3,pork cutlet is also very tasty but our religion does not allow us to eat it
./data/Client4\sample-003301.mp3,do i look as funny as you do
./data/Client4\sample-003302.mp3,the next day the boy returned to the well hoping to see the girl
./data/Client4\sample-003303.mp3,don't you see what's happening
./data/Client4\sample-003304.mp3,he started to read the book he had bought
./data/Client4\sample-003305.mp3,to do that successfully i must have no fear of failure
./data/Client4\sample-003306.mp3,where you got him
./data/Client4\sample-003307.mp3,the time must have been somewhere around six o'clock
./data/Client4\sample-003308.mp3,maybe these desert birds could explain to him the meaning of love without ownership
./data/Client4\sample-003309.mp3,but i don't have it
./data/Client4\sample-003310.mp3,he lives at the alfayoum oasis his friend had said
./data/Client4\sample-003311.mp3,where have you been for so long
./data/Client4\sample-003312.mp3,if you start your emails with greetings let me be the first to welcome you to earth
./data/Client4\sample-003313.mp3,the boy trusted his new friend
./data/Client4\sample-003314.mp3,you brought a new feeling into my crystal shop
./data/Client4\sample-003315.mp3,please use your turn signal
./data/Client4\sample-003316.mp3,he told me i should try to do so
./data/Client4\sample-003317.mp3,the old man wore a breastplate of heavy gold covered with precious stones
./data/Client4\sample-003318.mp3,if you have to wait until the war is over then wait
./data/Client4\sample-003319.mp3,hundreds must have seen it and taken it for a falling star
./data/Client4\sample-003320.mp3,i don't see him
./data/Client4\sample-003321.mp3,everything in life is an omen said the englishman now closing the journal he was reading
./data/Client4\sample-003322.mp3,i'm trying to explain to my mother how to get pictures off her phone
./data/Client4\sample-003323.mp3,he walked slowly through the market
./data/Client4\sample-003324.mp3,he thought that with some patience he'd be able to transform everything into gold
./data/Client4\sample-003325.mp3,i didn't do nothing
./data/Client4\sample-003326.mp3,vibrations of peace throughout the tent
./data/Client4\sample-003327.mp3,throughout the night the boy dug at the place he had chosen but found nothing
./data/Client4\sample-003328.mp3,he dressed in his arabian clothing of white linen bought especially for this day
./data/Client4\sample-003329.mp3,they continued across the desert
./data/Client4\sample-003330.mp3,she must have known alex pretty well
./data/Client4\sample-003331.mp3,the scabbard was embossed in silver and the handle was black and encrusted with precious stones
./data/Client4\sample-003332.mp3,get a suite at the imperial and hire some bodyguards
./data/Client4\sample-003333.mp3,maybe we're all that way the boy mused
./data/Client4\sample-003334.mp3,eventually the merchant had to hire two more employees
./data/Client4\sample-003335.mp3,people say strange things the boy thought
./data/Client4\sample-003336.mp3,he felt uneasy at the man's presence
./data/Client4\sample-003337.mp3,i have already described the appearance of that colossal bulk which was embedded in the ground
./data/Client4\sample-003338.mp3,i'd know that voice anywhere
./data/Client4\sample-003339.mp3,you know it is
./data/Client4\sample-003340.mp3,i'd know that voice anywhere
./data/Client4\sample-003341.mp3,how do you handle the negative weights
./data/Client4\sample-003342.mp3,the conversation was interrupted by the warehouse boss
./data/Client4\sample-003343.mp3,and they had understood each other perfectly well
./data/Client4\sample-003344.mp3,it was the old man who spoke first
./data/Client4\sample-003345.mp3,well interpret the dream he said
./data/Client4\sample-003346.mp3,the boy awoke before dawn
./data/Client4\sample-003347.mp3,the boy mumbled an answer that allowed him to avoid responding to her question
./data/Client4\sample-003348.mp3,i am here the boy said
./data/Client4\sample-003349.mp3,wait till those two future jailbirds read the morning post tomorrow
./data/Client4\sample-003350.mp3,i beg of you not to do this thing
./data/Client4\sample-003351.mp3,i found a little crowd of about twenty people surrounding the huge hole
./data/Client4\sample-003352.mp3,fatima the girl said averting her eyes
./data/Client4\sample-003353.mp3,it was more activity than usual for this time of the morning
./data/Client4\sample-003354.mp3,we were all made by the same hand and we have the same soul
./data/Client4\sample-003355.mp3,we know that and we are used to it
./data/Client4\sample-003356.mp3,i would if i thought i'd hear anything worth listening to
./data/Client4\sample-003357.mp3,where are you from the boy asked
./data/Client4\sample-003358.mp3,coming home a party of tourists passed us singing and playing music
./data/Client4\sample-003359.mp3,he was more confident in himself though and felt as though he could conquer the world
./data/Client4\sample-003360.mp3,the police have kindly provided us with a list
./data/Client4\sample-003361.mp3,the boy listened quietly
./data/Client4\sample-003362.mp3,then he took from his knapsack a bottle of wine and drank some
./data/Client4\sample-003363.mp3,before guns were invented armies had to throw bullets at each other and if a bullet touched you you had to sit out until the next war
./data/Client4\sample-003364.mp3,has aunt stephanie come in yet
./data/Client4\sample-003365.mp3,hitting the delete and escape keys did nothing
./data/Client4\sample-003366.mp3,he appeared with the first stars of evening
./data/Client4\sample-003367.mp3,june decided to retire
./data/Client4\sample-003368.mp3,eric took his vitamins and continued his exercise regime
./data/Client4\sample-003369.mp3,i'm the king of salem the old man had said
./data/Client4\sample-003370.mp3,it was faintly marked with transverse stripes and slightly flattened from the perfect round
./data/Client4\sample-003371.mp3,the sun thought for a minute
./data/Client4\sample-003372.mp3,she had pneumonia once
./data/Client4\sample-003373.mp3,from the railway station in the distance came the sound of trains ringing and rumbling
./data/Client4\sample-003374.mp3,that's never happened to me the boy said
./data/Client4\sample-003375.mp3,he left without saying goodbye to the crystal merchant
./data/Client4\sample-003376.mp3,you bet i've got a better offer
./data/Client4\sample-003377.mp3,i kept my eyes fixed on the cylinder and began pushing my way back from the edge of the pit
./data/Client4\sample-003378.mp3,i don't understand what you're talking about the desert said
./data/Client4\sample-003379.mp3,henderson went into the railway station to telegraph the news to london
./data/Client4\sample-003380.mp3,wait just a minute now
./data/Client4\sample-003381.mp3,can i at least keep the onion soup
./data/Client4\sample-003382.mp3,as they browsed the store together
./data/Client4\sample-003383.mp3,where your treasure is there also will be your heart the alchemist had told him
./data/Client4\sample-003384.mp3,it's called the principle of favorability
./data/Client4\sample-003385.mp3,the heather was on fire and you could see a thin blue smoke rising up slowly
./data/Client4\sample-003386.mp3,the tribal chieftains will see that and you'll be dismissed from your position as counselor
./data/Client4\sample-003387.mp3,i can always go back to being a shepherd the boy thought
./data/Client4\sample-003388.mp3,lioness rushes to defense of cub
./data/Client4\sample-003389.mp3,get me my check book
./data/Client4\sample-003390.mp3,it was impossible to remember all the details that he covered in an hour
./data/Client4\sample-003391.mp3,it's the master work of the alchemists
./data/Client4\sample-003392.mp3,make room for mrs chelsea
./data/Client4\sample-003393.mp3,absolutely despicable that gingerbread men are forced to live in houses made of their own flesh
./data/Client4\sample-003394.mp3,he still calls his mother 'mummy'
./data/Client4\sample-003395.mp3,i'll tell you what i'll do
./data/Client4\sample-003396.mp3,but nowhere could he find his new companion
./data/Client4\sample-003397.mp3,many people in berkshire surrey and middlesex must have seen it
./data/Client4\sample-003398.mp3,but everyone and his aunt lilian's been through that bag
./data/Client4\sample-003399.mp3,that florescent pink colour is hurting my eyes
./data/Client4\sample-003400.mp3,gentlemen of the press
./data/Client4\sample-003401.mp3,most of my friends have already finished college
./data/Client4\sample-003402.mp3,but that's why you created the game in the first place the boy answered
./data/Client4\sample-003403.mp3,i'm not going very far the alchemist answered looking straight into the eyes of the horsemen
./data/Client4\sample-003404.mp3,as the sun rose the men began to beat the boy
./data/Client4\sample-003405.mp3,i had seen all that it would presently bring me
./data/Client4\sample-003406.mp3,abraham provided many treats
./data/Client4\sample-003407.mp3,enough said the boy
./data/Client4\sample-003408.mp3,i have watched the caravan as it crossed the desert he said
./data/Client4\sample-003409.mp3,it was my fault for interfering
./data/Client4\sample-003410.mp3,they were relieved and happy
./data/Client4\sample-003411.mp3,the boy began again to read his book but he was no longer able to concentrate
./data/Client4\sample-003412.mp3,the thought was so dreadful to him that he forgot about the heat and went forward
./data/Client4\sample-003413.mp3,an huge hole had been made by the impact of the projectile
./data/Client4\sample-003414.mp3,the city was still sleeping
./data/Client4\sample-003415.mp3,are you going to listen
./data/Client4\sample-003416.mp3,and a big turtle fell from the sky
./data/Client4\sample-003417.mp3,what are you talking about
./data/Client4\sample-003418.mp3,naturally we have to do something about it
./data/Client4\sample-003419.mp3,now let's take a look at the candidates
./data/Client4\sample-003420.mp3,bakers have homes while shepherds sleep out in the open
./data/Client4\sample-003421.mp3,as i watched the planet seemed to grow larger and smaller
./data/Client4\sample-003422.mp3,where do you live shouted the boy as the horseman rode away
./data/Client4\sample-003423.mp3,like eating or sleeping or like seeking love or finding a job
./data/Client4\sample-003424.mp3,this was the strangest of all things that ever came to earth from outer space
./data/Client4\sample-003425.mp3,you have been a real blessing to me
./data/Client4\sample-003426.mp3,the night was warm and i was thirsty
./data/Client4\sample-003427.mp3,everyone seemed very excited
./data/Client4\sample-003428.mp3,he couldn't have been wrong
./data/Client4\sample-003429.mp3,don't you see what's happening
./data/Client4\sample-003430.mp3,i can work for the rest of today the boy answered
./data/Client4\sample-003431.mp3,the boy and the englishman had bought camels and climbed uncertainly onto their backs
./data/Client4\sample-003432.mp3,i think i will
./data/Client4\sample-003433.mp3,there must be some way
./data/Client4\sample-003434.mp3,the heather was on fire and you could see a thin blue smoke rising up slowly
./data/Client4\sample-003435.mp3,it brought his heart into his mouth
./data/Client4\sample-003436.mp3,his eyes filled with tears as he spoke of the prophet
./data/Client4\sample-003437.mp3,it's true life really is generous to those who pursue their destiny the boy thought
./data/Client4\sample-003438.mp3,a tow truck came to clear up the wreckage
./data/Client4\sample-003439.mp3,you'll watch them as they grow demonstrating how the world is always changing
./data/Client4\sample-003440.mp3,on the following day the first clear sign of danger appeared
./data/Client4\sample-003441.mp3,she never told her that
./data/Client4\sample-003442.mp3,even the guides spoke very little to one another
./data/Client4\sample-003443.mp3,it may be the gases of the firing that caused the martians inconvenience
./data/Client4\sample-003444.mp3,all the type  has been sent to salt lake
./data/Client4\sample-003445.mp3,this is what was written on the emerald tablet said the alchemist when he had finished
./data/Client4\sample-003446.mp3,henderson went into the railway station to telegraph the news to london
./data/Client4\sample-003447.mp3,everyone seemed very excited
./data/Client4\sample-003448.mp3,ogilvy watched till one and then gave up
./data/Client4\sample-003449.mp3,they're closing in on you
./data/Client4\sample-003450.mp3,everyone seemed very excited
./data/Client4\sample-003451.mp3,the extension tends to cause pages to hang and it requires that you speak the link you want to click on
./data/Client4\sample-003452.mp3,the car engine has seized
./data/Client4\sample-003453.mp3,at once he connected the two incidents
./data/Client4\sample-003454.mp3,the dead soldiers were replaced by others and life went on
./data/Client4\sample-003455.mp3,and this is for me said the alchemist keeping one of the parts
./data/Client4\sample-003456.mp3,she knows everything
./data/Client4\sample-003457.mp3,we've certainly been in some sweet jams
./data/Client4\sample-003458.mp3,henderson went into the railway station to telegraph the news to london
./data/Client4\sample-003459.mp3,he picked up the two stones and put them back in his pouch
./data/Client4\sample-003460.mp3,the boy smiled to himself
./data/Client4\sample-003461.mp3,i'm afraid that if my dream is realized i'll have no reason to go on living
./data/Client4\sample-003462.mp3,gotta be gentle to suit me
./data/Client4\sample-003463.mp3,then he sat in the sunfilled doorway smoking the hookah
./data/Client4\sample-003464.mp3,my phone is in my back pocket
./data/Client4\sample-003465.mp3,but there was something there in his heart that wouldn't allow him to do so
./data/Client4\sample-003466.mp3,it seemed as if what the old king had called beginner's luck were no longer functioning
./data/Client4\sample-003467.mp3,maybe these desert birds could explain to him the meaning of love without ownership
./data/Client4\sample-003468.mp3,i used to live near el cairum he said
./data/Client4\sample-003469.mp3,i think it's about bird hunting but now i can see how that might be misinterpreted
./data/Client4\sample-003470.mp3,the steel of its blade glittered in the light of the moon
./data/Client4\sample-003471.mp3,she went over to the hospital to call on professor davis
./data/Client4\sample-003472.mp3,he approached the mass and was surprised at the size and the shape
./data/Client4\sample-003473.mp3,but everyone and his aunt lilian's been through that bag
./data/Client4\sample-003474.mp3,i don't want anything for myself
./data/Client4\sample-003475.mp3,the boy was astonished by what he saw inside
./data/Client4\sample-003476.mp3,dont ever leave your hammer on the top of the ladder i said
./data/Client4\sample-003477.mp3,on the third day the chief met with his officers
./data/Client4\sample-003478.mp3,for crying out loud
./data/Client4\sample-003479.mp3,i'm gonna build air fields
./data/Client4\sample-003480.mp3,can i get a woot woot
./data/Client4\sample-003481.mp3,it isn't too late
./data/Client4\sample-003482.mp3,they were hiding him
./data/Client4\sample-003483.mp3,it's a good thing i got here in time
./data/Client4\sample-003484.mp3,yeah better if people are already familiar with one and are thinking of switching to the other
./data/Client4\sample-003485.mp3,do you know him
./data/Client4\sample-003486.mp3,all the birds began to sing at the first light of dawn
./data/Client4\sample-003487.mp3,there is only one way to learn the alchemist answered
./data/Client4\sample-003488.mp3,even me  i haven't thought of other women since i met the merchant's daughter
./data/Client4\sample-003489.mp3,the boy was sad as he left her that day
./data/Client4\sample-003490.mp3,a half a heelot
./data/Client4\sample-003491.mp3,they formed heaps that are visible a mile and a half away
./data/Client4\sample-003492.mp3,the router overheated and needed to be restarted
./data/Client4\sample-003493.mp3,the boy didn't say anything
./data/Client4\sample-003494.mp3,at this hour of the morning
./data/Client4\sample-003495.mp3,he noticed the unequal cooling of its surface
./data/Client4\sample-003496.mp3,she could still be alive
./data/Client4\sample-003497.mp3,stacey couldn't find the power switch
./data/Client4\sample-003498.mp3,alfayoum is in egypt said the arab
./data/Client4\sample-003499.mp3,my wife pointed out to me the brightness of the red green and yellow signal lights
./data/Client4\sample-003500.mp3,that's why i'm here
./data/Client4\sample-003501.mp3,are you going to listen
./data/Client4\sample-003502.mp3,i know good crystal from bad and everything else there is to know about crystal
./data/Client4\sample-003503.mp3,and what's the matter with a thousand dollars
./data/Client4\sample-003504.mp3,down below in the darkness were hundreds of people sleeping in peace
./data/Client4\sample-003505.mp3,you'll see a lot of strange things from now on
./data/Client4\sample-003506.mp3,at that time it was quite clear in my own mind that the thing had come from the planet mars
./data/Client4\sample-003507.mp3,don't tell me what to do
./data/Client4\sample-003508.mp3,i want to tell you a story about dreams said the alchemist
./data/Client4\sample-003509.mp3,and the odor of the animals became a bit more tolerable
./data/Client4\sample-003510.mp3,i have the diet of a kid who found twenty dollars
./data/Client4\sample-003511.mp3,a current of love rushed from his heart and the boy began to pray
./data/Client4\sample-003512.mp3,samantha's boots felt heavy and her chest was tightening
./data/Client4\sample-003513.mp3,i'd hate to have that many pins stuck in me
./data/Client4\sample-003514.mp3,and the hero has slain the giant dragon
./data/Client4\sample-003515.mp3,i know what it's going to be like
./data/Client4\sample-003516.mp3,his name is barry baldwin
./data/Client4\sample-003517.mp3,i accuse this man of being a faker
./data/Client4\sample-003518.mp3,among these people were a couple of cyclists a gardener i employed sometimes and a girl carrying a baby
./data/Client4\sample-003519.mp3,doctor kim dressed the wound with a bandage while looking disappointed at me
./data/Client4\sample-003520.mp3,ogilvy told him everything that he had seen
./data/Client4\sample-003521.mp3,i want you to be my wife
./data/Client4\sample-003522.mp3,it would be very useful if my web browser could synchronize all of its preferences not just some
./data/Client4\sample-003523.mp3,and so despite the fact that he was a roman centurion he converted to their faith
./data/Client4\sample-003524.mp3,in one he had read that many years ago a famous arabian alchemist had visited europe
./data/Client4\sample-003525.mp3,somebody pushed against me and i almost fell into the ditch
./data/Client4\sample-003526.mp3,it had a diameter of about thirty yards
./data/Client4\sample-003527.mp3,the python wasn't a snake it was a programming language
./data/Client4\sample-003528.mp3,it was starlight and i explained the signs of the zodiac to her
./data/Client4\sample-003529.mp3,we want you to know that we're all for you
./data/Client4\sample-003530.mp3,he saw that fatima's eyes were filled with tears
./data/Client4\sample-003531.mp3,then came the night of the first falling star
./data/Client4\sample-003532.mp3,your eyes show the strength of your soul answered the alchemist
./data/Client4\sample-003533.mp3,he brought six sheep with him
./data/Client4\sample-003534.mp3,this is for the boy
./data/Client4\sample-003535.mp3,he has done so much ghostwriting that he starts to feel like a ghost too
./data/Client4\sample-003536.mp3,so how will we name all these hurricanes
./data/Client4\sample-003537.mp3,is that the contract
./data/Client4\sample-003538.mp3,in his hand he grasped a snake by the tail
./data/Client4\sample-003539.mp3,the guitar broke and she couldn't play anymore
./data/Client4\sample-003540.mp3,i have watched the caravan as it crossed the desert he said
./data/Client4\sample-003541.mp3,kelly was interested in clearing up her brother's death
./data/Client4\sample-003542.mp3,a shepherd may like to travel but he should never forget about his sheep
./data/Client4\sample-003543.mp3,she would never know the difference because she didn't know how to read
./data/Client4\sample-003544.mp3,he didn't want to cry with the other people there
./data/Client4\sample-003545.mp3,and he wasn't faring much better
./data/Client4\sample-003546.mp3,the shower curtain is beige and white
./data/Client4\sample-003547.mp3,and a whole cold chicken staring us right in the face
./data/Client4\sample-003548.mp3,maktub thought the boy
./data/Client4\sample-003549.mp3,i wanted to sleep a little longer he thought
./data/Client4\sample-003550.mp3,throughout the entire day we will be on the lookout for our enemies
./data/Client4\sample-003551.mp3,using script blockers is generally a good idea but it requires the user to learn a bit
./data/Client4\sample-003552.mp3,there were raised voicesand some sort of struggle appeared to be going on 
./data/Client4\sample-003553.mp3,it's like the camel driver said 'eat when it's time to eat
./data/Client4\sample-003554.mp3,now i will drift gently off to dreamland
./data/Client4\sample-003555.mp3,the flight attendant winked at the obnoxious passenger seated next to me
./data/Client4\sample-003556.mp3,we don't know when the war will end so we can't continue our journey he said
./data/Client4\sample-003557.mp3,what are you doing here one of the figures demanded
./data/Client4\sample-003558.mp3,before guns were invented armies had to throw bullets at each other and if a bullet touched you you had to sit out until the next war
./data/Client4\sample-003559.mp3,it was such a gradual movement that he found it only by noticing the dots
./data/Client4\sample-003560.mp3,like everybody learns he said
./data/Client4\sample-003561.mp3,as nice as blake's
./data/Client4\sample-003562.mp3,she decided against it
./data/Client4\sample-003563.mp3,mine's in the door
./data/Client4\sample-003564.mp3,it seems old and wise
./data/Client4\sample-003565.mp3,they'd never let you go
./data/Client4\sample-003566.mp3,i swear it on my mother's grave
./data/Client4\sample-003567.mp3,the merchant was silent for a few moments
./data/Client4\sample-003568.mp3,if i was at a party where there was drinking involved i could call him and he would come pick me up and take me home
./data/Client4\sample-003569.mp3,the two were taken to a nearby military camp
./data/Client4\sample-003570.mp3,tomorrow morning at ten o'clock
./data/Client4\sample-003571.mp3,i remember how i sat on the table there in the blackness with patches of green and crimson swimming before my eyes
./data/Client4\sample-003572.mp3,they walked in from the rain all dishevelled and steaming
./data/Client4\sample-003573.mp3,after all what he had always wanted was just that to know new places
./data/Client4\sample-003574.mp3,i didn't know shepherds knew how to read said a girl's voice behind him
./data/Client4\sample-003575.mp3,but those who know about such things would know that those are urim and thummim
./data/Client4\sample-003576.mp3,the only shadow was that of the few scattered pine trees
./data/Client4\sample-003577.mp3,the girl dropped the container and the water spilled
./data/Client4\sample-003578.mp3,my friend said i love you
./data/Client4\sample-003579.mp3,from here on you will be alone the alchemist said
./data/Client4\sample-003580.mp3,when i returned to the common the sun was setting
./data/Client4\sample-003581.mp3,gypsies are experts at getting people to do that sighed the old man
./data/Client4\sample-003582.mp3,of course the two were unable to do anything
./data/Client4\sample-003583.mp3,i had seen all that it would presently bring me
./data/Client4\sample-003584.mp3,they crossed the desert for another two days in silence
./data/Client4\sample-003585.mp3,the pixel probabilities are conditioned on the model state
./data/Client4\sample-003586.mp3,the emerald tablet is a direct passage to the soul of the world
./data/Client4\sample-003587.mp3,in spite of this i still believed that there were men in mars
./data/Client4\sample-003588.mp3,and then i'm going to build things
./data/Client4\sample-003589.mp3,the experience in the coffin was literally immersive
./data/Client4\sample-003590.mp3,the merchants were assembling their stalls and the boy helped a candy seller to do his
./data/Client4\sample-003591.mp3,now what do you say
./data/Client4\sample-003592.mp3,but you know that i'm not going to go to mecca
./data/Client4\sample-003593.mp3,once to the thief and once to the general
./data/Client4\sample-003594.mp3,to keep on pitching
./data/Client4\sample-003595.mp3,your heart is alive
./data/Client4\sample-003596.mp3,if i don't find it i can always go home
./data/Client4\sample-003597.mp3,the ceiling collapsed inwards
./data/Client4\sample-003598.mp3,i am following my destiny
./data/Client4\sample-003599.mp3,the boy listened quietly
./data/Client4\sample-003600.mp3,alison couldn't help but feel pride in her creation
./data/Client4\sample-003601.mp3,servants came and went with silver trays laden with spices and tea
./data/Client4\sample-003602.mp3,the boy felt ill and terribly alone
./data/Client4\sample-003603.mp3,fresh coffee is much better than the freeze dried stuff
./data/Client4\sample-003604.mp3,it turned out to be a bitter tea
./data/Client4\sample-003605.mp3,aren't you allowed to kiss back
./data/Client4\sample-003606.mp3,we can't leave greg here
./data/Client4\sample-003607.mp3,the boy offered his bottle hoping that the old man would leave him alone
./data/Client4\sample-003608.mp3,when i'm eating that's all i think about
./data/Client4\sample-003609.mp3,scattered groups of people were hurrying from the direction of woking
./data/Client4\sample-003610.mp3,there is no wine in this country the young man said
./data/Client4\sample-003611.mp3,we're refugees from the tribal wars and we need money the other figure said
./data/Client4\sample-003612.mp3,it looked like a rusty gas float
./data/Client4\sample-003613.mp3,i ain't seen him for a week
./data/Client4\sample-003614.mp3,i'm going to them
./data/Client4\sample-003615.mp3,at most they thought that another meteorite had descended
./data/Client4\sample-003616.mp3,he told fatima that at their next meeting
./data/Client4\sample-003617.mp3,all that time the martians must have been getting ready
./data/Client4\sample-003618.mp3,since the miner had sacrificed everything to his destiny the old man decided to become involved
./data/Client4\sample-003619.mp3,he appeared with the first stars of evening
./data/Client4\sample-003620.mp3,we returned to the cemetery
./data/Client4\sample-003621.mp3,who'd you say was gonna get him
./data/Client4\sample-003622.mp3,now let's see what you look like when you protest
./data/Client4\sample-003623.mp3,bert the cop was wounded in north africa
./data/Client4\sample-003624.mp3,few people realise the immensity of vacancy
./data/Client4\sample-003625.mp3,i beg of you not to do this thing
./data/Client4\sample-003626.mp3,what would you do
./data/Client4\sample-003627.mp3,is there a crowd in the street
./data/Client4\sample-003628.mp3,you're losing your eye
./data/Client4\sample-003629.mp3,some of those who saw its flight say it travelled with a hissing sound
./data/Client4\sample-003630.mp3,no hope no adventure no old kings or destinies no treasure and no pyramids
./data/Client4\sample-003631.mp3,your father's had a stroke of luck
./data/Client4\sample-003632.mp3,they looked for the fallen mass but found nothing
./data/Client4\sample-003633.mp3,i beg your pardon
./data/Client4\sample-003634.mp3,he suggested that the boy look around the palace and return in two hours
./data/Client4\sample-003635.mp3,a fine bunch of reporters
./data/Client4\sample-003636.mp3,when he saw henderson in his garden he called over the fence and made himself understood
./data/Client4\sample-003637.mp3,the suspension bridge was swinging in the gale
./data/Client4\sample-003638.mp3,that's true enough the boy thought ruefully
./data/Client4\sample-003639.mp3,so he asked if the old man's blessing was still with him
./data/Client4\sample-003640.mp3,he made us stand and watch him paint for like an hour
./data/Client4\sample-003641.mp3,it was no more exciting than an overturned carriage or a tree blown across the road
./data/Client4\sample-003642.mp3,that's why i'm here
./data/Client4\sample-003643.mp3,oh its not such a big deal right away
./data/Client4\sample-003644.mp3,don't mind the colonel
./data/Client4\sample-003645.mp3,the men fell into an animated discussion
./data/Client4\sample-003646.mp3,we run smack into a police patrol
./data/Client4\sample-003647.mp3,march was windy and dark
./data/Client4\sample-003648.mp3,and then i'm going to build things
./data/Client4\sample-003649.mp3,don't tell me you didn't know it was loaded
./data/Client4\sample-003650.mp3,harry hoped he would see some success from the current project
./data/Client4\sample-003651.mp3,you've never been born
./data/Client4\sample-003652.mp3,but he still couldn't flee
./data/Client4\sample-003653.mp3,i have been wanting to go and waiting for him to go with me
./data/Client4\sample-003654.mp3,the boy didn't know what a person's destiny was
./data/Client4\sample-003655.mp3,the wind's curiosity was aroused something that had never happened before
./data/Client4\sample-003656.mp3,bakers have homes while shepherds sleep out in the open
./data/Client4\sample-003657.mp3,i would like to take a nice long break with no financial repercussions but we all know thats not going to happen
./data/Client4\sample-003658.mp3,some place to live
./data/Client4\sample-003659.mp3,i got drunk yesterday and thought i built a super computer
./data/Client4\sample-003660.mp3,the men fell into an animated discussion
./data/Client4\sample-003661.mp3,it was as if it quivered but really this was the telescope vibrating
./data/Client4\sample-003662.mp3,having heard that the boy became even more interested in alchemy
./data/Client4\sample-003663.mp3,and now it was only four days before he would be back in that same village
./data/Client4\sample-003664.mp3,even me  i haven't thought of other women since i met the merchant's daughter
./data/Client4\sample-003665.mp3,that might be all right
./data/Client4\sample-003666.mp3,he loosened the reins on his horse who galloped forward over the rocks and sand
./data/Client4\sample-003667.mp3,the queen sampled the selection of cakes
./data/Client4\sample-003668.mp3,the sun was setting when the boy's heart sounded a danger signal
./data/Client4\sample-003669.mp3,he started to read the book he had bought
./data/Client4\sample-003670.mp3,he's on the way
./data/Client4\sample-003671.mp3,you don't happen to have eight thousand bucks on you
./data/Client4\sample-003672.mp3,they begin creeping up on you trying to sell you something
./data/Client4\sample-003673.mp3,the desert was all sand in some stretches and rocky in others
./data/Client4\sample-003674.mp3,on the seventh day the alchemist decided to make camp earlier than usual
./data/Client4\sample-003675.mp3,they began to ride out over the sands with the moon lighting their way
./data/Client4\sample-003676.mp3,at most they thought that another meteorite had descended
./data/Client4\sample-003677.mp3,it turned out to be a bitter tea
./data/Client4\sample-003678.mp3,get martin out of jail
./data/Client4\sample-003679.mp3,when i returned to the common the sun was setting
./data/Client4\sample-003680.mp3,how did you learn to read the girl asked at one point
./data/Client4\sample-003681.mp3,is it all right
./data/Client4\sample-003682.mp3,this moisturising cream is fantastic
./data/Client4\sample-003683.mp3,i would have won the junior olympics if not for those medaling kids
./data/Client4\sample-003684.mp3,the plastic barrier shattered
./data/Client4\sample-003685.mp3,why was it that he wanted the boy to serve as his instrument
./data/Client4\sample-003686.mp3,so now i fear nothing because it was those omens that brought you to me
./data/Client4\sample-003687.mp3,the old man returned the book to the boy
./data/Client4\sample-003688.mp3,you have helped me the man continued to prepare his tea saying nothing
./data/Client4\sample-003689.mp3,she would never know the difference because she didn't know how to read
./data/Client4\sample-003690.mp3,well interpret the dream he said
./data/Client4\sample-003691.mp3,all the villagers cheered
./data/Client4\sample-003692.mp3,undefined
./data/Client4\sample-003693.mp3,besides that there was a heap of bicycles
./data/Client4\sample-003694.mp3,where you got him
./data/Client4\sample-003695.mp3,but you will love her and she'll return your love
./data/Client4\sample-003696.mp3,henderson stood up with a spade in his hand
./data/Client4\sample-003697.mp3,he was twenty minutes from his tent and began to make his way there
./data/Client4\sample-003698.mp3,go back to watching the caravan he said
./data/Client4\sample-003699.mp3,the boy reached the small abandoned church just as night was falling
./data/Client4\sample-003700.mp3,the old man wore a breastplate of gold and he knew about my past
./data/Client4\sample-003701.mp3,i could die happily and that made me feel good
./data/Client4\sample-003702.mp3,what about the blue one
./data/Client4\sample-003703.mp3,i waited all afternoon and evening he said
./data/Client4\sample-003704.mp3,and he decided he would go to see the chiefs of the tribes
./data/Client4\sample-003705.mp3,you look at me as if you didn't know me
./data/Client4\sample-003706.mp3,don't let her shoot
./data/Client4\sample-003707.mp3,that night he told all of this to the alchemist
./data/Client4\sample-003708.mp3,i have had the same dream twice he said
./data/Client4\sample-003709.mp3,it was glaringly hot not a cloud in the sky nor a breath of wind
./data/Client4\sample-003710.mp3,dense clouds of smoke or dust can be seen through a powerful telescope
./data/Client4\sample-003711.mp3,golden penguins are so last season
./data/Client4\sample-003712.mp3,the war continued and at times the wind carried the sweet sickly smell of blood
./data/Client4\sample-003713.mp3,the idea frightened him
./data/Client4\sample-003714.mp3,but there's a tribal war the boy reiterated
./data/Client4\sample-003715.mp3,but use them to buy your flock
./data/Client4\sample-003716.mp3,replace the ts in tim tebow's name with any other consonant to get a star wars character
./data/Client4\sample-003717.mp3,all who went there were happy at having done so
./data/Client4\sample-003718.mp3,we could get to the pyramids by tomorrow said the other taking the money
./data/Client4\sample-003719.mp3,fatima the girl said averting her eyes
./data/Client4\sample-003720.mp3,he didn't need to demonstrate his science and art to anyone
./data/Client4\sample-003721.mp3,you're a man disgusted with all of civilization
./data/Client4\sample-003722.mp3,he was already re accustomed to desert's silence
./data/Client4\sample-003723.mp3,i'm not going very far the alchemist answered looking straight into the eyes of the horsemen
./data/Client4\sample-003724.mp3,i found a little crowd of about twenty people surrounding the huge hole
./data/Client4\sample-003725.mp3,my review of the sun one star
./data/Client4\sample-003726.mp3,i read only what the birds wanted to tell me
./data/Client4\sample-003727.mp3,but the boy was quiet
./data/Client4\sample-003728.mp3,same way you did
./data/Client4\sample-003729.mp3,goats always have a better view
./data/Client4\sample-003730.mp3,the alchemist stopped abruptly and bent to the ground
./data/Client4\sample-003731.mp3,it was more activity than usual for this time of the morning
./data/Client4\sample-003732.mp3,he expertly gutted the rabbit
./data/Client4\sample-003733.mp3,some went away while i was there and other people came
./data/Client4\sample-003734.mp3,what are you doing here one of the figures demanded
./data/Client4\sample-003735.mp3,you can't say that about my father
./data/Client4\sample-003736.mp3,if i told you it might not come true
./data/Client4\sample-003737.mp3,but now the sounds inside had stopped
./data/Client4\sample-003738.mp3,that's not true the boy said
./data/Client4\sample-003739.mp3,dense clouds of smoke or dust can be seen through a powerful telescope
./data/Client4\sample-003740.mp3,that sobered him a little
./data/Client4\sample-003741.mp3,i'll be right with you
./data/Client4\sample-003742.mp3,i shall make us some ice cubes
./data/Client4\sample-003743.mp3,even though the sheep didn't teach me to speak arabic
./data/Client4\sample-003744.mp3,i wanted them to be a part of your inheritance
./data/Client4\sample-003745.mp3,yet each felt his heart beat a bit faster
./data/Client4\sample-003746.mp3,what a wonderful weather
./data/Client4\sample-003747.mp3,they continued across the desert
./data/Client4\sample-003748.mp3,much better said the old man
./data/Client4\sample-003749.mp3,so he could not be hasty nor impatient
./data/Client4\sample-003750.mp3,but horses tire bit by bit
./data/Client4\sample-003751.mp3,it was faintly marked with transverse stripes and slightly flattened from the perfect round
./data/Client4\sample-003752.mp3,it's the other foreigner the englishman
./data/Client4\sample-003753.mp3,goodbye said the boy
./data/Client4\sample-003754.mp3,before the boy could reply a butterfly appeared and fluttered between him and the old man
./data/Client4\sample-003755.mp3,a line of flame high can be seen in the atmosphere
./data/Client4\sample-003756.mp3,i like icecream
./data/Client4\sample-003757.mp3,that's a good luck omen the englishman said after the fat arab had gone out
./data/Client4\sample-003758.mp3,on the  o'clock train
./data/Client4\sample-003759.mp3,then he realized that he had been distracted for a few moments looking at the sword
./data/Client4\sample-003760.mp3,the tradition teaches men how to cross the desert and how their children should marry
./data/Client4\sample-003761.mp3,it was however still so hot from its flight through the air
./data/Client4\sample-003762.mp3,but he granted the travelers three days
./data/Client4\sample-003763.mp3,i waited all afternoon and evening he said
./data/Client4\sample-003764.mp3,this morning i found a calculator taped to my wii
./data/Client4\sample-003765.mp3,'and this is what your son said' the angel told the man
./data/Client4\sample-003766.mp3,the cinema was abandoned
./data/Client4\sample-003767.mp3,one by one the campfires were extinguished and the oasis fell as quiet as the desert
./data/Client4\sample-003768.mp3,alison couldn't help but feel pride in her creation
./data/Client4\sample-003769.mp3,the boy spent a sleepless night
./data/Client4\sample-003770.mp3,of course the two were unable to do anything
./data/Client4\sample-003771.mp3,it turned out to be a bitter tea
./data/Client4\sample-003772.mp3,some of the grey ash was falling off the circular edge
./data/Client4\sample-003773.mp3,he asked it please never to stop speaking to him
./data/Client4\sample-003774.mp3,every day was there to be lived or to mark one's departure from this world
./data/Client4\sample-003775.mp3,only when he himself reveals it
./data/Client4\sample-003776.mp3,love is the falcon's flight over your sands
./data/Client4\sample-003777.mp3,didn't you tell her
./data/Client4\sample-003778.mp3,they had gone away to breakfast at henderson's house
./data/Client4\sample-003779.mp3,of course the two were unable to do anything
./data/Client4\sample-003780.mp3,he was able to get on his knees but he quickly slipped back
./data/Client4\sample-003781.mp3,there were just drawings coded instructions and obscure texts
./data/Client4\sample-003782.mp3,i don't know how to turn them into reality
./data/Client4\sample-003783.mp3,the strange horseman drew an enormous curved sword from a scabbard mounted on his saddle
./data/Client4\sample-003784.mp3,he's followed every game and his mouth's watering
./data/Client4\sample-003785.mp3,we've got something a whole lot bigger than that
./data/Client4\sample-003786.mp3,but he didn't stop
./data/Client4\sample-003787.mp3,do you want to go to work for me the merchant asked
./data/Client4\sample-003788.mp3,the thing itself was almost entirely buried in sand
./data/Client4\sample-003789.mp3,well it's a long list
./data/Client4\sample-003790.mp3,this is the mayor
./data/Client4\sample-003791.mp3,i'm an old superstitious arab and i believe in our proverbs
./data/Client4\sample-003792.mp3,the train pulled into the station
./data/Client4\sample-003793.mp3,there were just drawings coded instructions and obscure texts
./data/Client4\sample-003794.mp3,but we could sell tea in crystal glasses
./data/Client4\sample-003795.mp3,listen to that mob
./data/Client4\sample-003796.mp3,the battles may last for a long time perhaps even years
./data/Client4\sample-003797.mp3,tomorrow at this same time bring me a tenth of your flock
./data/Client4\sample-003798.mp3,let me out of here
./data/Client4\sample-003799.mp3,the next day he gave his son a pouch that held three ancient spanish gold coins
./data/Client4\sample-003800.mp3,my tax dollars pay for those public school proms
./data/Client4\sample-003801.mp3,i sold crystal and crossed the desert
./data/Client4\sample-003802.mp3,breakfast is usually earlier than this she thought
./data/Client4\sample-003803.mp3,she's good enough for me
./data/Client4\sample-003804.mp3,you're not going anywhere
./data/Client4\sample-003805.mp3,the idea frightened him
./data/Client4\sample-003806.mp3,it always helps to be learning something new and exciting
./data/Client4\sample-003807.mp3,what is the benefit of the method in terms of identification accuracy
./data/Client4\sample-003808.mp3,it could be computed in many ways which would give more or less equivalent results
./data/Client4\sample-003809.mp3,i don't understand what you're talking about the desert said
./data/Client4\sample-003810.mp3,how to avoid a massive dieoff of the colony
./data/Client4\sample-003811.mp3,absolutely despicable that gingerbread men are forced to live in houses made of their own flesh
./data/Client4\sample-003812.mp3,something inside the cylinder was unscrewing the top
./data/Client4\sample-003813.mp3,i'm going to find that damned alchemist the englishman thought
./data/Client4\sample-003814.mp3,starting with his own
./data/Client4\sample-003815.mp3,we've got to walk up to the tower
./data/Client4\sample-003816.mp3,i can clean up those glasses in the window if you want said the boy
./data/Client4\sample-003817.mp3,he thought of all the married shepherds he had known
./data/Client4\sample-003818.mp3,so when i look out over your sands i am also looking at her
./data/Client4\sample-003819.mp3,except for the dream
./data/Client4\sample-003820.mp3,scattered groups of people were hurrying from the direction of woking
./data/Client4\sample-003821.mp3,i'm afraid that if my dream is realized i'll have no reason to go on living
./data/Client4\sample-003822.mp3,it was something that i thought could happen only to others never to me
./data/Client4\sample-003823.mp3,he paused and his eyes were still unfriendly
./data/Client4\sample-003824.mp3,one million two hundred and fifty thousand dollars
./data/Client4\sample-003825.mp3,down below in the darkness were hundreds of people sleeping in peace
./data/Client4\sample-003826.mp3,heads popping back behind doors
./data/Client4\sample-003827.mp3,the review of related methods is simple to understand and informative
./data/Client4\sample-003828.mp3,none of this ha d made an impression on the boy
./data/Client4\sample-003829.mp3,jill caught the ball that peter had thrown towards her
./data/Client4\sample-003830.mp3,it looked like a rusty gas float
./data/Client4\sample-003831.mp3,but those who know about such things would know that those are urim and thummim
./data/Client4\sample-003832.mp3,next you'll want to enumerate tabs so you can quickly jump between them
./data/Client4\sample-003833.mp3,the top of the cylinder was rotating on its body
./data/Client4\sample-003834.mp3,it's the only answer
./data/Client4\sample-003835.mp3,of course the two were unable to do anything
./data/Client4\sample-003836.mp3,arabs often appeared in the city shopping and chanting their strange prayers several times a day
./data/Client4\sample-003837.mp3,as the sun rose the men began to beat the boy
./data/Client4\sample-003838.mp3,i used to live near el cairum he said
./data/Client4\sample-003839.mp3,most meteorites are more or less rounded
./data/Client4\sample-003840.mp3,but he found it much more interesting to observe the caravan and listen to the wind
./data/Client4\sample-003841.mp3,it must have fallen while i was sitting over there
./data/Client4\sample-003842.mp3,get me my check book
./data/Client4\sample-003843.mp3,among these people were a couple of cyclists a gardener i employed sometimes and a girl carrying a baby
./data/Client4\sample-003844.mp3,which one are you
./data/Client4\sample-003845.mp3,did you speak to mr norton
./data/Client4\sample-003846.mp3,it's good to see you
./data/Client4\sample-003847.mp3,the burning fire had been extinguished
./data/Client4\sample-003848.mp3,the streamer of gas came out towards us
./data/Client4\sample-003849.mp3,ogilvy watched till one and then gave up
./data/Client4\sample-003850.mp3,at once he connected the two incidents
./data/Client4\sample-003851.mp3,he quickly pulled his hands away
./data/Client4\sample-003852.mp3,the brass lamp had been disturbed
./data/Client4\sample-003853.mp3,worked hard just to have food and water like the sheep
./data/Client4\sample-003854.mp3,i have already described the appearance of that colossal bulk which was embedded in the ground
./data/Client4\sample-003855.mp3,'m all about those invisible cosmic connections that transcend time and distance
./data/Client4\sample-003856.mp3,when i returned to the common the sun was setting
./data/Client4\sample-003857.mp3,i waited all afternoon and evening he said
./data/Client4\sample-003858.mp3,did you know there's a swimming pool under this floor
./data/Client4\sample-003859.mp3,the boy laughed  out of happiness
./data/Client4\sample-003860.mp3,its lower end was still embedded
./data/Client4\sample-003861.mp3,but i found it difficult to get to work because of the investigations
./data/Client4\sample-003862.mp3,we'll stay right here and celebrate
./data/Client4\sample-003863.mp3,just handling them made him feel better
./data/Client4\sample-003864.mp3,i don't know the desert that well yet
./data/Client4\sample-003865.mp3,do you want to bankrupt this administration
./data/Client4\sample-003866.mp3,it seemed so safe and tranquil
./data/Client4\sample-003867.mp3,you know how dreams are
./data/Client4\sample-003868.mp3,it seemed such a little thing so bright and small and still
./data/Client4\sample-003869.mp3,when can i see him
./data/Client4\sample-003870.mp3,it may be the gases of the firing that caused the martians inconvenience
./data/Client4\sample-003871.mp3,keep your shirt on
./data/Client4\sample-003872.mp3,i had never heard of alchemists before the boy said
./data/Client4\sample-003873.mp3,she went over to mr jared's house
./data/Client4\sample-003874.mp3,how about that check
./data/Client4\sample-003875.mp3,the boy offered his bottle hoping that the old man would leave him alone
./data/Client4\sample-003876.mp3,an huge hole had been made by the impact of the projectile
./data/Client4\sample-003877.mp3,that day the merchant gave the boy permission to build the display
./data/Client4\sample-003878.mp3,a boy came running towards me
./data/Client4\sample-003879.mp3,it was the devil
./data/Client4\sample-003880.mp3,he was planning as he left the bar
./data/Client4\sample-003881.mp3,reality was permanently scarred from those force field experiments
./data/Client4\sample-003882.mp3,the day was dawning and the shepherd urged his sheep in the direction of the sun
./data/Client4\sample-003883.mp3,the plumber tightened the leaking valve
./data/Client4\sample-003884.mp3,he put a sign on the door and they went to a small cafe nearby
./data/Client4\sample-003885.mp3,the greatest authority on meteorites stated that the height of its first appearance was about ninety or one hundred miles
./data/Client4\sample-003886.mp3,it could get a whole lot worse
./data/Client4\sample-003887.mp3,my wife pointed out to me the brightness of the red green and yellow signal lights
./data/Client4\sample-003888.mp3,hundreds of observers saw the flame that night and the night after
./data/Client4\sample-003889.mp3,his name is welch
./data/Client4\sample-003890.mp3,i pointed out mars a bright dot of light
./data/Client4\sample-003891.mp3,and for wise men gold is the metal that evolved the furthest
./data/Client4\sample-003892.mp3,i finally have enough money and all the time i need
./data/Client4\sample-003893.mp3,sometimes their caravan met with another
./data/Client4\sample-003894.mp3,take good care of him
./data/Client4\sample-003895.mp3,sometimes their caravan met with another
./data/Client4\sample-003896.mp3,wear the blue one
./data/Client4\sample-003897.mp3,and yet none of these people has ever met the old king
./data/Client4\sample-003898.mp3,i can see april coming
./data/Client4\sample-003899.mp3,he felt uneasy at the man's presence
./data/Client4\sample-003900.mp3,and now it was only four days before he would be back in that same village
./data/Client4\sample-003901.mp3,do you have any secret hiding place here in the house
./data/Client4\sample-003902.mp3,they stood there looking at the moon
./data/Client4\sample-003903.mp3,i had seen all that it would presently bring me
./data/Client4\sample-003904.mp3,he didn't mind the extra work
./data/Client4\sample-003905.mp3,they went out of business years ago
./data/Client4\sample-003906.mp3,the boy approached her to ask about the alchemist
./data/Client4\sample-003907.mp3,because of the omens the alchemist answered
./data/Client4\sample-003908.mp3,gold would lose its value
./data/Client4\sample-003909.mp3,they were people of the desert and clamored to hear his stories about the great cities
./data/Client4\sample-003910.mp3,henderson was taking it in
./data/Client4\sample-003911.mp3,i'm sending it over with beth
./data/Client4\sample-003912.mp3,people are going off relief
./data/Client4\sample-003913.mp3,i can always go back to being a shepherd the boy thought
./data/Client4\sample-003914.mp3,no doubt the impact had caused a flash of fire
./data/Client4\sample-003915.mp3,how do you do
./data/Client4\sample-003916.mp3,the simum blew that day as it had never blown before
./data/Client4\sample-003917.mp3,mostly just the hearts of those who are trying to realize their destinies
./data/Client4\sample-003918.mp3,i found myself alone and saw the people on the other side of the pit running away
./data/Client4\sample-003919.mp3,she was the one in charge of everything
./data/Client4\sample-003920.mp3,that it was unable to deal with this boy who spoke the language of the world
./data/Client4\sample-003921.mp3,somebody should eat the mango i guess it is me
./data/Client4\sample-003922.mp3,fortytwo is not a random number
./data/Client4\sample-003923.mp3,but fatima's hands held to the handles of her jug
./data/Client4\sample-003924.mp3,how strange africa is thought the boy
./data/Client4\sample-003925.mp3,it's not a battle of good against evil
./data/Client4\sample-003926.mp3,had our instruments permitted it we might have been able to see the trouble way back when
./data/Client4\sample-003927.mp3,he had seen the shooting star and was persuaded that a meteorite lay somewhere nearby
./data/Client4\sample-003928.mp3,the boy wanted to believe that his friend had simply become separated from him by accident
./data/Client4\sample-003929.mp3,i learned the alchemist's secrets in my travels
./data/Client4\sample-003930.mp3,she was supposed to come down and get you
./data/Client4\sample-003931.mp3,the next day the boy returned to the well hoping to see the girl
./data/Client4\sample-003932.mp3,it wasn't there
./data/Client4\sample-003933.mp3,love is the falcon's flight over your sands
./data/Client4\sample-003934.mp3,this morning i found a calculator taped to my wii
./data/Client4\sample-003935.mp3,the international space station is an awesome project
./data/Client4\sample-003936.mp3,we want to see you
./data/Client4\sample-003937.mp3,only you expected it to be like other marriages
./data/Client4\sample-003938.mp3,i thought that everything i owned would be destroyed
./data/Client4\sample-003939.mp3,they were given to me as a present by a king the boy said
./data/Client4\sample-003940.mp3,i'm going to become bitter and distrustful of people because one person betrayed me
./data/Client4\sample-003941.mp3,strange images passed through my mind
./data/Client4\sample-003942.mp3,she says it's nothing to worry about
./data/Client4\sample-003943.mp3,he had seen the shooting star and was persuaded that a meteorite lay somewhere nearby
./data/Client4\sample-003944.mp3,don't you remember the home i promised you
./data/Client4\sample-003945.mp3,you can only spit out so many seeds
./data/Client4\sample-003946.mp3,what do you mean by that
./data/Client4\sample-003947.mp3,as i watched the planet seemed to grow larger and smaller
./data/Client4\sample-003948.mp3,they were known as seers and they were held in fear by women and the elderly
./data/Client4\sample-003949.mp3,it was glaringly hot not a cloud in the sky nor a breath of wind
./data/Client4\sample-003950.mp3,they wanted to save the oasis
./data/Client4\sample-003951.mp3,it was a strange furnace fueled by firewood with a transparent flask heating on top
./data/Client4\sample-003952.mp3,besides that there was a heap of bicycles
./data/Client4\sample-003953.mp3,we'll get you out in ten minutes
./data/Client4\sample-003954.mp3,he had been to the village only once the year before
./data/Client4\sample-003955.mp3,i'd like to live in it
./data/Client4\sample-003956.mp3,he waited patiently for the merchant to awaken and open the shop
./data/Client4\sample-003957.mp3,you don't call this a convenience
./data/Client4\sample-003958.mp3,he sat on a stone and allowed himself to become hypnotized by the horizon
./data/Client4\sample-003959.mp3,do you know someone here who cures people's illnesses the boy asked
./data/Client4\sample-003960.mp3,the burning fire had been extinguished
./data/Client4\sample-003961.mp3,he felt weighted down by the centuries of time since the pyramids had been built
./data/Client4\sample-003962.mp3,help me the boy said
./data/Client4\sample-003963.mp3,there were mountains in the distance
./data/Client4\sample-003964.mp3,some of the grey ash was falling off the circular edge
./data/Client4\sample-003965.mp3,i know its dimensions and how it behaves
./data/Client4\sample-003966.mp3,he just got a new kite for his birthday
./data/Client4\sample-003967.mp3,there was very little talking
./data/Client4\sample-003968.mp3,i'm surprised the boy said
./data/Client4\sample-003969.mp3,he put his headcloth in place and secured it with a ring made of camel skin
./data/Client4\sample-003970.mp3,we lit the lantern and walked over to his house
./data/Client4\sample-003971.mp3,after all who doesnt want to overcome new challenges and achieve great heights
./data/Client4\sample-003972.mp3,i dreamt i was your father
./data/Client4\sample-003973.mp3,even the guides spoke very little to one another
./data/Client4\sample-003974.mp3,you were seen at the enemy camp three days ago
./data/Client4\sample-003975.mp3,at most they thought that another meteorite had descended
./data/Client4\sample-003976.mp3,never mind what desk
./data/Client4\sample-003977.mp3,it was such a gradual movement that he found it only by noticing the dots
./data/Client4\sample-003978.mp3,by the light of their own destruction i saw them staggering and falling and their supporters turning to run
./data/Client4\sample-003979.mp3,but they could never have taught him arabic
./data/Client4\sample-003980.mp3,the boy had never even noticed that there was a hole in his pouch
./data/Client4\sample-003981.mp3,he had been so far away that his face wasn't even visible
./data/Client4\sample-003982.mp3,looking through the telescope i saw a circle of deep blue and the little round planet
./data/Client4\sample-003983.mp3,i'll tell you why they did it
./data/Client4\sample-003984.mp3,even if you're an expert reading all of it is often not feasible due to lack of time
./data/Client4\sample-003985.mp3,maybe he should not call people names that they don't want to be called
./data/Client4\sample-003986.mp3,they don't see that the fields are new and the seasons change
./data/Client4\sample-003987.mp3,it's up to you
./data/Client4\sample-003988.mp3,it was better than the scent of the hookahs
./data/Client4\sample-003989.mp3,and at that i told him and he took my place
./data/Client4\sample-003990.mp3,he wanted to tell him about fatima
./data/Client4\sample-003991.mp3,they reminded him of the old man
./data/Client4\sample-003992.mp3,why didn't i call you back
./data/Client4\sample-003993.mp3,can you imagine that
./data/Client4\sample-003994.mp3,he thought of the merchant's daughter and was sure that she had probably married
./data/Client4\sample-003995.mp3,during the third year the omens will continue to speak of your treasure and your destiny
./data/Client4\sample-003996.mp3,it was faintly marked with transverse stripes and slightly flattened from the perfect round
./data/Client4\sample-003997.mp3,i don't much like change he said
./data/Client4\sample-003998.mp3,a large portion of the cylinder had been uncovered
./data/Client4\sample-003999.mp3,she carefully removed the evidence from its packaging
