./data/Client1\sample-000012.mp3,my wife pointed out to me the brightness of the red green and yellow signal lights
./data/Client1\sample-000013.mp3,but he had found a guide and didn't want to miss out on an opportunity
./data/Client1\sample-000014.mp3,as they began to decorate the hallway a silhouette appeared in the doorway
./data/Client1\sample-000015.mp3,i couldnt stop staring at it
./data/Client1\sample-000016.mp3,he was my brother
./data/Client1\sample-000017.mp3,but he decided to take a chance
./data/Client1\sample-000018.mp3,we'll pay all your expenses
./data/Client1\sample-000019.mp3,then they got ahold of some dough and went goofy

./data/Client1\sample-000027.mp3,don't let them see that you're afraid the alchemist said
./data/Client1\sample-000028.mp3,you couldn't even be honest about being dishonest
./data/Client1\sample-000029.mp3,the fire alarm went off again but when i looked outside there was no one there
./data/Client1\sample-000030.mp3,coming home a party of tourists passed us singing and playing music
./data/Client1\sample-000031.mp3,before guns were invented armies had to throw bullets at each other and if a bullet touched you you had to sit out until the next war
./data/Client1\sample-000032.mp3,before guns were invented armies had to throw bullets at each other and if a bullet touched you you had to sit out until the next war

./data/Client1\sample-000034.mp3,i have had the same dream twice he said
./data/Client1\sample-000035.mp3,the boy was strong and wanted to retaliate but he was in a foreign country
./data/Client1\sample-000036.mp3,ask the owner of that stall how much the sword costs he said to his friend
./data/Client1\sample-000037.mp3,it was dropping off in flakes and raining down on the sand
./data/Client1\sample-000038.mp3,maybe that's why they give up on it so early too
./data/Client1\sample-000039.mp3,a large piece suddenly came off and fell with a loud and sharp noise
./data/Client1\sample-000040.mp3,the snow blasted along the side of the bridge

./data/Client1\sample-000044.mp3,they were people of the desert and clamored to hear his stories about the great cities
./data/Client1\sample-000045.mp3,my seven year resume gap is marked not drugs
./data/Client1\sample-000046.mp3,there was absolutely no reason for her to announce it to the entire company
./data/Client1\sample-000047.mp3,most of them were staring quietly at the big table
./data/Client1\sample-000048.mp3,you wanna take this outside
./data/Client1\sample-000049.mp3,so how will we name all these hurricanes
./data/Client1\sample-000050.mp3,just the ant colony of the neighborhood
./data/Client1\sample-000051.mp3,so the boy was disappointed he decided that he would never again believe in dreams
./data/Client1\sample-000052.mp3,how do you mean
./data/Client1\sample-000053.mp3,don't you know that girl's very sick

./data/Client1\sample-000076.mp3,he didn't need to demonstrate his science and art to anyone
./data/Client1\sample-000077.mp3,it was faintly marked with transverse stripes and slightly flattened from the perfect round
./data/Client1\sample-000078.mp3,but you don't know about love
./data/Client1\sample-000079.mp3,but then he remembered that he wasn't going to have to pay anything
./data/Client1\sample-000080.mp3,why do you want to find that sort of person the arab asked
./data/Client1\sample-000081.mp3,the shop is exactly the size i always wanted it to be

./data/Client1\sample-000083.mp3,i just don't trust anyone who says they've never had hamburger helper

./data/Client1\sample-000086.mp3,his hands were abraded and exhausted but he listened to his heart
./data/Client1\sample-000087.mp3,the alchemist followed as the boy's horse ran for almost half an hour
./data/Client1\sample-000088.mp3,all this happened between sunrise and sunset the boy thought
./data/Client1\sample-000089.mp3,shall i put a little rum in the coffee
./data/Client1\sample-000090.mp3,to nourish the falcon
./data/Client1\sample-000091.mp3,show me where there is life out in the desert
./data/Client1\sample-000092.mp3,who is this stranger who speaks of omens asked one of the chieftains eyeing the boy
./data/Client1\sample-000093.mp3,help my friend mr richard
./data/Client1\sample-000094.mp3,want to walk to new york
./data/Client1\sample-000095.mp3,dense clouds of smoke or dust can be seen through a powerful telescope

./data/Client1\sample-000097.mp3,it's late in the evening a perfect time for coffee
./data/Client1\sample-000098.mp3,i only interpret dreams
./data/Client1\sample-000099.mp3,the boss sent me over with it
./data/Client1\sample-000100.mp3,half an hour later his shovel hit something solid
./data/Client1\sample-000101.mp3,the fumes from the traffic was unbearable
./data/Client1\sample-000102.mp3,about eleven i walked back to my home in maybury because nothing seemed to be happening
./data/Client1\sample-000103.mp3,the level ground was blackened as far as one could see and it was still giving off smoke
./data/Client1\sample-000104.mp3,but he decided to take a chance
./data/Client1\sample-000105.mp3,it was immediately apparent
./data/Client1\sample-000106.mp3,i don't understand what you're talking about the desert said
./data/Client1\sample-000107.mp3,the englishman had several suitcases filled with books
./data/Client1\sample-000108.mp3,he sat on a stone and allowed himself to become hypnotized by the horizon
./data/Client1\sample-000109.mp3,it is i the boy answered
./data/Client1\sample-000110.mp3,wish i had a million dollars
./data/Client1\sample-000111.mp3,he still calls his mother 'mummy'
./data/Client1\sample-000112.mp3,it's common to run into problems so read the instructions carefully
./data/Client1\sample-000113.mp3,just handling them made him feel better
./data/Client1\sample-000114.mp3,the boy noticed that the owner of the bar stood nearby listening attentively to their conversation
./data/Client1\sample-000115.mp3,harry'll tear his dinner suit
./data/Client1\sample-000116.mp3,sometime during the second year you'll remember about the treasure
./data/Client1\sample-000117.mp3,you've got his gun
./data/Client1\sample-000118.mp3,his hands were abraded and exhausted but he listened to his heart
./data/Client1\sample-000119.mp3,it's not cheap but it matters a lot
./data/Client1\sample-000120.mp3,we must be good
./data/Client1\sample-000121.mp3,watch over her tonight
./data/Client1\sample-000122.mp3,don't give in to your fears said the alchemist in a strangely gentle voice
./data/Client1\sample-000123.mp3,there's a moon out tonight
./data/Client1\sample-000124.mp3,the boy repeated his question
./data/Client1\sample-000125.mp3,revenge is not my style but obviously accidents will happen
./data/Client1\sample-000126.mp3,you're a week late for school already
./data/Client1\sample-000127.mp3,you wanna take this outside
./data/Client1\sample-000128.mp3,you have told me about your dreams about the old king and your treasure
./data/Client1\sample-000129.mp3,but the boy was quiet
./data/Client1\sample-000130.mp3,revenge is not my style but obviously accidents will happen
./data/Client1\sample-000131.mp3,the levanter increased in intensity
./data/Client1\sample-000132.mp3,with the girl with the raven hair his days would never be the same again
./data/Client1\sample-000133.mp3,he heard a muffled grating sound and saw the black mark jerk forward an inch or so
./data/Client1\sample-000134.mp3,wear the blue one
./data/Client1\sample-000135.mp3,like crickets and like expectations like lizards and fourleaf clovers
./data/Client1\sample-000136.mp3,i guess you're right
./data/Client1\sample-000137.mp3,i thought about the difficulties in translation that might arise
./data/Client1\sample-000138.mp3,there was very little talking
./data/Client1\sample-000139.mp3,the two walked out among the palms
./data/Client1\sample-000140.mp3,he had been so far away that his face wasn't even visible
./data/Client1\sample-000141.mp3,they formed heaps that are visible a mile and a half away
./data/Client1\sample-000142.mp3,men have never understood the words of the wise
./data/Client1\sample-000143.mp3,hundreds must have seen it and taken it for a falling star
./data/Client1\sample-000144.mp3,'m all about those invisible cosmic connections that transcend time and distance
./data/Client1\sample-000145.mp3,get the bulletin board
./data/Client1\sample-000146.mp3,they were strange books
./data/Client1\sample-000147.mp3,you told me that
./data/Client1\sample-000148.mp3,no doubt the impact had caused a flash of fire
./data/Client1\sample-000149.mp3,do you want to wake that baby
./data/Client1\sample-000150.mp3,two days later the merchant spoke to the boy about the display
./data/Client1\sample-000151.mp3,i never stole a watch in my life
./data/Client1\sample-000152.mp3,good luck to you
./data/Client1\sample-000153.mp3,maybe tomorrow said the boy moving away
./data/Client1\sample-000154.mp3,i was just asking
./data/Client1\sample-000155.mp3,let him have everything he wants
./data/Client1\sample-000156.mp3,the following night the boy appeared at the alchemist's tent with a horse
./data/Client1\sample-000157.mp3,one can imagine these two covered with sand running up the little street in the bright sunlight
./data/Client1\sample-000158.mp3,egypt is a country that is often mentioned in the bible
./data/Client1\sample-000159.mp3,he was alarmed by what had happened
./data/Client1\sample-000160.mp3,the boy knew and was now working toward it
./data/Client1\sample-000161.mp3,lucy's a newspaper woman
./data/Client1\sample-000162.mp3,to realize one's destiny is a person's only real obligation
./data/Client1\sample-000163.mp3,their faces were hidden behind blue veils with only their eyes showing
./data/Client1\sample-000164.mp3,it is i who dared to do so said the boy
./data/Client1\sample-000165.mp3,this is for you he said holding one of the parts out to the monk
./data/Client1\sample-000166.mp3,when i returned to the common the sun was setting
./data/Client1\sample-000167.mp3,the boy waited and then interrupted the old man just as he himself had been interrupted
./data/Client1\sample-000168.mp3,the alarm clock was set for twenty past three
./data/Client1\sample-000169.mp3,most of them were staring quietly at the big table
./data/Client1\sample-000170.mp3,coming home a party of tourists passed us singing and playing music
./data/Client1\sample-000171.mp3,the boy went to the well every day to meet with fatima
./data/Client1\sample-000172.mp3,it's the name of the prophet's daughter fatima said
./data/Client1\sample-000173.mp3,i myself heard nothing of that
./data/Client1\sample-000174.mp3,the boy remembered his dream and suddenly everything was clear to him
./data/Client1\sample-000175.mp3,get some water quickly
./data/Client1\sample-000176.mp3,the boy prodded them one by one with his crook calling each by name
./data/Client1\sample-000177.mp3,there was a loud shriek from a woman standing behind us
./data/Client1\sample-000178.mp3,then leave with the caravan
./data/Client1\sample-000179.mp3,he is going to transform himself into the wind just to demonstrate his powers
./data/Client1\sample-000180.mp3,you're still a good reporter
./data/Client1\sample-000181.mp3,show me where there is life out in the desert
./data/Client1\sample-000182.mp3,there isn't any more wine
./data/Client1\sample-000183.mp3,does this belong to you
./data/Client1\sample-000184.mp3,the boy was shocked
./data/Client1\sample-000185.mp3,they wanted to save the oasis
./data/Client1\sample-000186.mp3,two horsemen waiting ahead of them
./data/Client1\sample-000187.mp3,i never said i'd take it
./data/Client1\sample-000188.mp3,i don't much like change he said
./data/Client1\sample-000189.mp3,the dunes are changed by the wind but the desert never changes
./data/Client1\sample-000190.mp3,suddenly he disappeared and i could hear a faint shriek behind the walls
./data/Client1\sample-000191.mp3,don't argue with me here
./data/Client1\sample-000192.mp3,he's in my room
./data/Client1\sample-000193.mp3,is she as good as you say
./data/Client1\sample-000194.mp3,they filled three sacks
./data/Client1\sample-000195.mp3,ogilvy watched till one and then gave up
./data/Client1\sample-000196.mp3,this is the morning post you're talking to
./data/Client1\sample-000197.mp3,you will spend that hour getting acquainted with marshall bailey
./data/Client1\sample-000198.mp3,the old man returned the book to the boy
./data/Client1\sample-000199.mp3,it was just that he couldn't grasp what it meant
./data/Client1\sample-000200.mp3,there must be somebody there
./data/Client1\sample-000201.mp3,my mind ran on the possibilities of its content
./data/Client1\sample-000202.mp3,i'm the king of salem the old man had said
./data/Client1\sample-000203.mp3,i know its dimensions and how it behaves
./data/Client1\sample-000204.mp3,our merchants bought that man and brought him to egypt
./data/Client1\sample-000205.mp3,i couldnt stop staring at it
./data/Client1\sample-000206.mp3,tomorrow sell your camel and buy a horse
./data/Client1\sample-000207.mp3,get down quick
./data/Client1\sample-000208.mp3,two days later the merchant spoke to the boy about the display
./data/Client1\sample-000209.mp3,his arm seemed to be battling with whatever was in the hole
./data/Client1\sample-000210.mp3,you haven't got your wings yet
./data/Client1\sample-000211.mp3,it was harassment pure and simple
./data/Client1\sample-000212.mp3,the old man opened his cape and the boy was struck by what he saw
./data/Client1\sample-000213.mp3,how was that for a tight squeeze
./data/Client1\sample-000214.mp3,he said to float away to happy land on the bubbles
./data/Client1\sample-000215.mp3,who's got the room next to hers
./data/Client1\sample-000216.mp3,they were given to me as a present by a king the boy said
./data/Client1\sample-000217.mp3,gives you an idea of the season
./data/Client1\sample-000218.mp3,the display was underwhelming
./data/Client1\sample-000219.mp3,now i want to ask you fellows a couple of questions
./data/Client1\sample-000220.mp3,none of what the old man was saying made much sense to the boy
./data/Client1\sample-000221.mp3,the strange horseman drew an enormous curved sword from a scabbard mounted on his saddle
./data/Client1\sample-000222.mp3,i'm gonna build air fields
./data/Client1\sample-000223.mp3,how could you even think that
./data/Client1\sample-000224.mp3,a pox upon me for a clumsy thing
./data/Client1\sample-000225.mp3,stove's hotter than i thought
./data/Client1\sample-000226.mp3,don't argue with me here
./data/Client1\sample-000227.mp3,there was nothing to hold him back except himself
./data/Client1\sample-000228.mp3,it was no more exciting than an overturned carriage or a tree blown across the road
./data/Client1\sample-000229.mp3,you think it's easy
./data/Client1\sample-000230.mp3,this was the strangest of all things that ever came to earth from outer space
./data/Client1\sample-000231.mp3,i can clean up those glasses in the window if you want said the boy
./data/Client1\sample-000232.mp3,the wireless joypad was experiencing connection issues
./data/Client1\sample-000233.mp3,after all who doesnt want to overcome new challenges and achieve great heights
./data/Client1\sample-000234.mp3,does a man's heart always help him the boy asked the alchemist
./data/Client1\sample-000235.mp3,it's like the camel driver said 'eat when it's time to eat
./data/Client1\sample-000236.mp3,lucy's a newspaper woman
./data/Client1\sample-000237.mp3,that's why all children should be nice
./data/Client1\sample-000238.mp3,this is a trick to get your sympathy
./data/Client1\sample-000239.mp3,it's extremely suspicious that there's no information about brains that didn't come from a brain
./data/Client1\sample-000240.mp3,the shop was busy and the man asked the shepherd to wait until the afternoon
./data/Client1\sample-000241.mp3,scattered groups of people were hurrying from the direction of woking
./data/Client1\sample-000242.mp3,tonight they would find out the truth
./data/Client1\sample-000243.mp3,mostly just the hearts of those who are trying to realize their destinies
./data/Client1\sample-000244.mp3,that sobered him a little
./data/Client1\sample-000245.mp3,show me where there is life out in the desert
./data/Client1\sample-000246.mp3,he had assumed he would soon return to his sheep
./data/Client1\sample-000247.mp3,it was however still so hot from its flight through the air
./data/Client1\sample-000248.mp3,no the alchemist answered
./data/Client1\sample-000249.mp3,we don't know what's in the confounded thing do you
./data/Client1\sample-000250.mp3,how much is it worth
./data/Client1\sample-000251.mp3,i found these one day in the fields
./data/Client1\sample-000252.mp3,this is a common misconception sheldon said
./data/Client1\sample-000253.mp3,i don't know what she's talking about
./data/Client1\sample-000254.mp3,it all happened rather suddenly
./data/Client1\sample-000255.mp3,sure see you there
./data/Client1\sample-000256.mp3,they set off running wildly into the trees
./data/Client1\sample-000257.mp3,a lot of these people are out of work
./data/Client1\sample-000258.mp3,he noticed the unequal cooling of its surface
./data/Client1\sample-000259.mp3,one can imagine these two covered with sand running up the little street in the bright sunlight
./data/Client1\sample-000260.mp3,maybe we'd better ask someone the boy suggested
./data/Client1\sample-000261.mp3,patrick has terminal cancer
./data/Client1\sample-000262.mp3,this is jon davis
./data/Client1\sample-000263.mp3,the world speaks many languages the boy thought
./data/Client1\sample-000264.mp3,one afternoon one of his servants fell ill and it appeared that he would die
./data/Client1\sample-000265.mp3,according to the predominant notion in the vatican condoms shouldn't be used in spite of hiv
./data/Client1\sample-000266.mp3,but you are forcing me to look at wealth and at horizons i have never known
./data/Client1\sample-000267.mp3,they erased all evidence of their crimes
./data/Client1\sample-000268.mp3,he paid for the wool and asked the shepherd to come back the following year
./data/Client1\sample-000269.mp3,the loafers and golf caddies were used to hanging out near the railway station
./data/Client1\sample-000270.mp3,and it's not love to see everything from a distance like you do
./data/Client1\sample-000271.mp3,he said to float away to happy land on the bubbles
./data/Client1\sample-000272.mp3,the boy continued to listen to his heart as they crossed the desert
./data/Client1\sample-000273.mp3,i wish you wouldn't
./data/Client1\sample-000274.mp3,i was wondering if you could tell me a bit more about what it's like to live and work there
./data/Client1\sample-000275.mp3,my friend bought all the other sheep immediately
./data/Client1\sample-000276.mp3,arabs often appeared in the city shopping and chanting their strange prayers several times a day
./data/Client1\sample-000277.mp3,there is a reptile in my western shoes
./data/Client1\sample-000278.mp3,how are you
./data/Client1\sample-000279.mp3,i want to stay at the oasis the boy answered
./data/Client1\sample-000280.mp3,and one or two persons were returning
./data/Client1\sample-000281.mp3,what's in that desk
./data/Client1\sample-000282.mp3,i found a little crowd of about twenty people surrounding the huge hole
./data/Client1\sample-000283.mp3,i got drunk yesterday and thought i built a super computer
./data/Client1\sample-000284.mp3,the boy had met the alchemist
./data/Client1\sample-000285.mp3,so when i look out over your sands i am also looking at her
./data/Client1\sample-000286.mp3,dusk was falling as the boy arrived with his herd at an abandoned church
./data/Client1\sample-000287.mp3,everything i do is friendly
./data/Client1\sample-000288.mp3,because he knew what he would find
./data/Client1\sample-000289.mp3,in his heart he wanted to remain awake but he also wanted to sleep
./data/Client1\sample-000290.mp3,the boy didn't say anything
./data/Client1\sample-000291.mp3,there were just drawings coded instructions and obscure texts
./data/Client1\sample-000292.mp3,and the sand and gravel had been flung violently in every direction
./data/Client1\sample-000293.mp3,what's your name he asked
./data/Client1\sample-000294.mp3,that's got nothing to do with it
./data/Client1\sample-000295.mp3,i heard a faint movement under my feet
./data/Client1\sample-000296.mp3,the boy swore that every time he heard the alarm he would heed its message
./data/Client1\sample-000297.mp3,i just don't trust anyone who says they've never had hamburger helper
./data/Client1\sample-000298.mp3,i have watched the caravan as it crossed the desert he said
./data/Client1\sample-000299.mp3,we can only perceive a part of the broad light spectrum the sun emits
./data/Client1\sample-000300.mp3,the dead soldiers were replaced by others and life went on
./data/Client1\sample-000301.mp3,they blow across the world without a birthplace and with no place to die
./data/Client1\sample-000302.mp3,finally a young woman approached who was not dressed in black
./data/Client1\sample-000303.mp3,i don't know you from adam
./data/Client1\sample-000304.mp3,they were racing down the streets with no regard for anyone
./data/Client1\sample-000305.mp3,there was very little talking
./data/Client1\sample-000306.mp3,it was the time of day when all of spain slept during the summer
./data/Client1\sample-000307.mp3,they erased all evidence of their crimes
./data/Client1\sample-000308.mp3,theresa couldn't feel any more dumb right now
./data/Client1\sample-000309.mp3,he's allergic to him
./data/Client1\sample-000310.mp3,i didn't have time to get some stylish underwear
./data/Client1\sample-000311.mp3,thirty every thursday sixty at sixty who knows what
./data/Client1\sample-000312.mp3,i found a little crowd of about twenty people surrounding the huge hole
./data/Client1\sample-000313.mp3,a thin circle of bright metal showed between the top and the body of the cylinder
./data/Client1\sample-000314.mp3,sometime during the second year you'll remember about the treasure
./data/Client1\sample-000315.mp3,i'm not hiding anything the boy answered
./data/Client1\sample-000316.mp3,you dominated those horsemen with the way you looked at them he said
./data/Client1\sample-000317.mp3,don't argue with me here
./data/Client1\sample-000318.mp3,there's a lot more you can do with a tighter integration with the eye tracking api
./data/Client1\sample-000319.mp3,he knew what i was thinking the boy said to himself
./data/Client1\sample-000320.mp3,what were you going to write about hillary
./data/Client1\sample-000321.mp3,he was about the same age and height as the boy
./data/Client1\sample-000322.mp3,johnathan assessed the situation carefully
./data/Client1\sample-000323.mp3,that he wanted to travel
./data/Client1\sample-000324.mp3,sadly my dream of becoming a squirrel whisperer may never happen
./data/Client1\sample-000325.mp3,he had tried in vain to establish a relationship with an alchemist
./data/Client1\sample-000326.mp3,he knew nothing about the customs of the strange land he was in
./data/Client1\sample-000327.mp3,from that day on it was the desert that would be important
./data/Client1\sample-000328.mp3,it's the oasis said the camel driver
./data/Client1\sample-000329.mp3,and the girl pointed to the south indicating that it was there the strange man lived
./data/Client1\sample-000330.mp3,it was seen early in the morning rushing over eastward
./data/Client1\sample-000331.mp3,well then why do we need all these books the boy asked
./data/Client1\sample-000332.mp3,it was a strange furnace fueled by firewood with a transparent flask heating on top
./data/Client1\sample-000333.mp3,had our instruments permitted it we might have been able to see the trouble way back when
./data/Client1\sample-000334.mp3,so immerse yourself in it
./data/Client1\sample-000335.mp3,why did you want to see me the boy asked
./data/Client1\sample-000336.mp3,be careful with your prognostications said the stranger
./data/Client1\sample-000337.mp3,his name is welch
./data/Client1\sample-000338.mp3,they said nothing else
./data/Client1\sample-000339.mp3,but that was simply because my eye was tired
./data/Client1\sample-000340.mp3,you don't have to be rich skinny popular or even own a cape to perform a random act of kindness
./data/Client1\sample-000341.mp3,the turf and gravel around it seemed charred as if by a sudden explosion
./data/Client1\sample-000342.mp3,the man looked at the angel in surprise
./data/Client1\sample-000343.mp3,but they were not there
./data/Client1\sample-000344.mp3,then the two went off to have some more tea
./data/Client1\sample-000345.mp3,that was his work
./data/Client1\sample-000346.mp3,what your husband was mixed up in
./data/Client1\sample-000347.mp3,the boy recalled the brilliance he had noticed on the previous day
./data/Client1\sample-000348.mp3,if i'm on the march i just concentrate on marching
./data/Client1\sample-000349.mp3,we don't know when the war will end so we can't continue our journey he said
./data/Client1\sample-000350.mp3,there is no wine in this country the young man said
./data/Client1\sample-000351.mp3,the night was warm and i was thirsty
./data/Client1\sample-000352.mp3,it's the only one they had left
./data/Client1\sample-000353.mp3,and a labor leader like melville
./data/Client1\sample-000354.mp3,his way isn't the same as mine nor mine as his
./data/Client1\sample-000355.mp3,you don't have to be rich skinny popular or even own a cape to perform a random act of kindness
./data/Client1\sample-000356.mp3,there was no other baggage
./data/Client1\sample-000357.mp3,but the boy was quiet
./data/Client1\sample-000358.mp3,did you say a king he asked
./data/Client1\sample-000359.mp3,what he said reminded the boy of the old king
./data/Client1\sample-000360.mp3,but we could sell tea in crystal glasses
./data/Client1\sample-000361.mp3,he was thinking about omens and someone had appeared
./data/Client1\sample-000362.mp3,don't take any chances
./data/Client1\sample-000363.mp3,in the discotheque the dj played progressive house music and trance
./data/Client1\sample-000364.mp3,i went stretching my legs clumsily and feeling my way in the dark
./data/Client1\sample-000365.mp3,i've watched you grow up from a little boy
./data/Client1\sample-000366.mp3,it's the only name i've got
./data/Client1\sample-000367.mp3,the greatest authority on meteorites stated that the height of its first appearance was about ninety or one hundred miles
./data/Client1\sample-000368.mp3,they're only made of rock crystal and there are millions of rock crystals in the earth
./data/Client1\sample-000369.mp3,i want to see the chieftains
./data/Client1\sample-000370.mp3,it has happened many times before
./data/Client1\sample-000371.mp3,the boy was surprised at his thoughts
./data/Client1\sample-000372.mp3,that day the merchant gave the boy permission to build the display
./data/Client1\sample-000373.mp3,sadly my dream of becoming a squirrel whisperer may never happen
./data/Client1\sample-000374.mp3,but as time passed tangier had changed
./data/Client1\sample-000375.mp3,my keychain is heavy and awkward to carry in my pocket
./data/Client1\sample-000376.mp3,i have already found my treasure
./data/Client1\sample-000377.mp3,the old man knew how to read and had already read the book
./data/Client1\sample-000378.mp3,then the thing came upon him in a flash
./data/Client1\sample-000379.mp3,i know that girl
./data/Client1\sample-000380.mp3,he thought of the woman who had trusted in the desert
./data/Client1\sample-000381.mp3,but horses tire bit by bit
./data/Client1\sample-000382.mp3,sadly my dream of becoming a squirrel whisperer may never happen
./data/Client1\sample-000383.mp3,listen to your heart
./data/Client1\sample-000384.mp3,to realize one's destiny is a person's only real obligation
./data/Client1\sample-000385.mp3,hires two personal trainers and make one of them train the other one
./data/Client1\sample-000386.mp3,the tribal chieftain called for the boy and presented him with fifty pieces of gold
./data/Client1\sample-000387.mp3,how could he be a fake
./data/Client1\sample-000388.mp3,the shop folks were taking down their shutters and people were opening their bedroom windows
./data/Client1\sample-000389.mp3,my seven year resume gap is marked not drugs
./data/Client1\sample-000390.mp3,all that time the martians must have been getting ready
./data/Client1\sample-000391.mp3,i feel like a bootlegger
./data/Client1\sample-000392.mp3,it was dropping off in flakes and raining down on the sand
./data/Client1\sample-000393.mp3,then get out of here
./data/Client1\sample-000394.mp3,the accommodation was affordable and cosy
./data/Client1\sample-000395.mp3,of course the two were unable to do anything
./data/Client1\sample-000396.mp3,they were both silent for a time observing the plaza and the townspeople
./data/Client1\sample-000397.mp3,it was however still so hot from its flight through the air
./data/Client1\sample-000398.mp3,you all know me
./data/Client1\sample-000399.mp3,we're just slowly plodding through some user interviews at the moment
./data/Client1\sample-000400.mp3,i wouldn't want to use that tub
./data/Client1\sample-000401.mp3,a shepherd may like to travel but he should never forget about his sheep
./data/Client1\sample-000402.mp3,this desert was once a sea he said
./data/Client1\sample-000403.mp3,because the crystal was dirty
./data/Client1\sample-000404.mp3,one day the earth began to tremble and the nile overflowed its banks
./data/Client1\sample-000405.mp3,he had no idea how he was going to transform himself into the wind
./data/Client1\sample-000406.mp3,they returned to the gates of the monastery
./data/Client1\sample-000407.mp3,air was either entering or escaping at the rim with a thin sizzling sound
./data/Client1\sample-000408.mp3,that might be all right
./data/Client1\sample-000409.mp3,i only interpret dreams
./data/Client1\sample-000410.mp3,don't take any chances
./data/Client1\sample-000411.mp3,they returned to the gates of the monastery
./data/Client1\sample-000412.mp3,it brought his heart into his mouth
./data/Client1\sample-000413.mp3,she joined up too
./data/Client1\sample-000414.mp3,strange images passed through my mind
./data/Client1\sample-000415.mp3,we have also started contemplating the possibility of moving back to colorado
./data/Client1\sample-000416.mp3,there's life here the boy said to the alchemist
./data/Client1\sample-000417.mp3,you couldn't even be honest about being dishonest
./data/Client1\sample-000418.mp3,i'm going to them
./data/Client1\sample-000419.mp3,my wife pointed out to me the brightness of the red green and yellow signal lights
./data/Client1\sample-000420.mp3,it belongs to me now
./data/Client1\sample-000421.mp3,has he been here
./data/Client1\sample-000422.mp3,but instead of being saddened he was happy
./data/Client1\sample-000423.mp3,you said you wanted fireworks
./data/Client1\sample-000424.mp3,the boy prodded them one by one with his crook calling each by name
./data/Client1\sample-000425.mp3,a thin circle of bright metal showed between the top and the body of the cylinder
./data/Client1\sample-000426.mp3,they set off running wildly into the trees
./data/Client1\sample-000427.mp3,i wish they were too
./data/Client1\sample-000428.mp3,he remembered the sword
./data/Client1\sample-000429.mp3,servants came and went with silver trays laden with spices and tea
./data/Client1\sample-000430.mp3,they were always just somebody to fill up the bleachers
./data/Client1\sample-000431.mp3,dont fight fire with fire it would not help
./data/Client1\sample-000432.mp3,there was a shimmering green light emanating from the statue
./data/Client1\sample-000433.mp3,the top of the cylinder was rotating on its body
./data/Client1\sample-000434.mp3,he disappeared into the tent
./data/Client1\sample-000435.mp3,he just got a new kite for his birthday
./data/Client1\sample-000436.mp3,it left a greenish streak that glowed for some seconds
./data/Client1\sample-000437.mp3,nobody's trying to steal from you
./data/Client1\sample-000438.mp3,but he found it much more interesting to observe the caravan and listen to the wind
./data/Client1\sample-000439.mp3,it considers the horizontal dimension as time
./data/Client1\sample-000440.mp3,he had done this for years and knew the schedule of everyone who passed
./data/Client1\sample-000441.mp3,always heed the omens the old king had said
./data/Client1\sample-000442.mp3,it commenced to blow harder raising the desert sands
./data/Client1\sample-000443.mp3,well what good would it be to you if you had t die the alchemist answered
./data/Client1\sample-000444.mp3,i thought about the difficulties in translation that might arise
./data/Client1\sample-000445.mp3,carol saved her brother's life that day
./data/Client1\sample-000446.mp3,in spite of this i still believed that there were men in mars
./data/Client1\sample-000447.mp3,that he had attended a seminary until he was sixteen
./data/Client1\sample-000448.mp3,i'm going to find that damned alchemist the englishman thought
./data/Client1\sample-000449.mp3,keep him in here
./data/Client1\sample-000450.mp3,maybe tomorrow will be better than yesterday
./data/Client1\sample-000451.mp3,she must have known alex pretty well
./data/Client1\sample-000452.mp3,the problem is that they don't even realize that they're walking a new road every day
./data/Client1\sample-000453.mp3,when the simum ceased to blow everyone looked to the place where the boy had been
./data/Client1\sample-000454.mp3,the forest burned for thirteen days
./data/Client1\sample-000455.mp3,when he saw henderson in his garden he called over the fence and made himself understood
./data/Client1\sample-000456.mp3,i have no information about troops or about the movement of the tribes
./data/Client1\sample-000457.mp3,he washed the detritus from his hair
./data/Client1\sample-000458.mp3,that's what alchemists do
./data/Client1\sample-000459.mp3,he dressed in his arabian clothing of white linen bought especially for this day
./data/Client1\sample-000460.mp3,the restaurant was quite expensive
./data/Client1\sample-000461.mp3,phone the newspapers
./data/Client1\sample-000462.mp3,he approached the mass and was surprised at the size and the shape
./data/Client1\sample-000463.mp3,he arose and taking up his crook began to awaken the sheep that still slept
./data/Client1\sample-000464.mp3,the shepherd swore that he would
./data/Client1\sample-000465.mp3,and you've told me nothing along the way said the boy
./data/Client1\sample-000466.mp3,maktub thought the boy
./data/Client1\sample-000467.mp3,i didn't frisk him
./data/Client1\sample-000468.mp3,he dressed in his arabian clothing of white linen bought especially for this day
./data/Client1\sample-000469.mp3,mostly just the hearts of those who are trying to realize their destinies
./data/Client1\sample-000470.mp3,you've never been born
./data/Client1\sample-000471.mp3,hundreds must have seen it and taken it for a falling star
./data/Client1\sample-000472.mp3,i'm leaving today said the boy
./data/Client1\sample-000473.mp3,they could barely see the boy
./data/Client1\sample-000474.mp3,i have to find a man who knows that universal language
./data/Client1\sample-000475.mp3,and tomorrow his enemy would also be a part of that soul
./data/Client1\sample-000476.mp3,i noticed that the boy answered
./data/Client1\sample-000477.mp3,so then try he said to the englishman
./data/Client1\sample-000478.mp3,i don't believe it
./data/Client1\sample-000479.mp3,the virus spread faster than wildfire
./data/Client1\sample-000480.mp3,the first rule of don't fight club is let's talk about it
./data/Client1\sample-000481.mp3,i understand sheep they're no longer a problem and they can be good friends
./data/Client1\sample-000482.mp3,the top of the cylinder was rotating on its body
./data/Client1\sample-000483.mp3,perhaps she met somebody
./data/Client1\sample-000484.mp3,take your paws off me
./data/Client1\sample-000485.mp3,apple pie is an iconic dish
./data/Client1\sample-000486.mp3,am i going to find my treasure he asked
./data/Client1\sample-000487.mp3,the achieved results are far behind the stateoftheart in image classification
./data/Client1\sample-000488.mp3,the boy brought his horse closer
./data/Client1\sample-000489.mp3,coach has heard all about you
./data/Client1\sample-000490.mp3,the sun was turned into a golden disk
./data/Client1\sample-000491.mp3,ogilvy watched till one and then gave up
./data/Client1\sample-000492.mp3,the turf and gravel around it seemed charred as if by a sudden explosion
./data/Client1\sample-000493.mp3,and you ought to read more about the world answered the englishman
./data/Client1\sample-000494.mp3,if he abandons that pursuit it's because it wasn't truelove
./data/Client1\sample-000495.mp3,the oasis is neutral ground
./data/Client1\sample-000496.mp3,what do you say
./data/Client1\sample-000497.mp3,i had seen all that it would presently bring me
./data/Client1\sample-000498.mp3,at the first glance it was really not very exciting
./data/Client1\sample-000499.mp3,sure i know where she lives
./data/Client1\sample-000500.mp3,he's the man the ads are written for
./data/Client1\sample-000501.mp3,and above all don't forget to follow your destiny through to its conclusion
./data/Client1\sample-000502.mp3,her achievements will never be forgotten
./data/Client1\sample-000503.mp3,i need to sell some wool the boy told the merchant
./data/Client1\sample-000504.mp3,we want some action in these pictures
./data/Client1\sample-000505.mp3,symbols of the little people
./data/Client1\sample-000506.mp3,this guy stole my watch
./data/Client1\sample-000507.mp3,it was the most delicious wine he had ever tasted
./data/Client1\sample-000508.mp3,it had a diameter of about thirty yards
./data/Client1\sample-000509.mp3,the old man knew how to read and had already read the book
./data/Client1\sample-000510.mp3,the space was spartan almost bare
./data/Client1\sample-000511.mp3,do you mind if we go someplace crowded
./data/Client1\sample-000512.mp3,it was such a gradual movement that he found it only by noticing the dots
./data/Client1\sample-000513.mp3,all they wanted was food and water
./data/Client1\sample-000514.mp3,it looked like a rusty gas float
./data/Client1\sample-000515.mp3,he's the only husband i've got
./data/Client1\sample-000516.mp3,this is for you
./data/Client1\sample-000517.mp3,the boy awoke before dawn
./data/Client1\sample-000518.mp3,he never asked me to sit down in his life
./data/Client1\sample-000519.mp3,my name's pete davis
./data/Client1\sample-000520.mp3,pretty nice neck you've got there
./data/Client1\sample-000521.mp3,an army is coming the boy said
./data/Client1\sample-000522.mp3,you've never been born
./data/Client1\sample-000523.mp3,you mean here in the city
./data/Client1\sample-000524.mp3,remember that wherever your heart is there you will find your treasure
./data/Client1\sample-000525.mp3,remember that wherever your heart is there you will find your treasure
./data/Client1\sample-000526.mp3,i have watched the caravan as it crossed the desert he said
./data/Client1\sample-000527.mp3,the boy approached her to ask about the alchemist
./data/Client1\sample-000528.mp3,the shop folks were taking down their shutters and people were opening their bedroom windows
./data/Client1\sample-000529.mp3,i think they perceived that nothing was to be done at the moment
./data/Client1\sample-000530.mp3,as soon as he saw me among the crowd he called to me to come down
./data/Client1\sample-000531.mp3,he approached the mass and was surprised at the size and the shape
./data/Client1\sample-000532.mp3,the boy was shocked
./data/Client1\sample-000533.mp3,the boy felt ill and terribly alone
./data/Client1\sample-000534.mp3,but that was simply because my eye was tired
./data/Client1\sample-000535.mp3,will you excuse us a minute
./data/Client1\sample-000536.mp3,i'm loving it
./data/Client1\sample-000537.mp3,as i watched the planet seemed to grow larger and smaller
./data/Client1\sample-000538.mp3,you can't believe it's not butter
./data/Client1\sample-000539.mp3,your heart is alive
./data/Client1\sample-000540.mp3,people from all over the world have passed through this village son said his father
./data/Client1\sample-000541.mp3,and they had understood each other perfectly well
./data/Client1\sample-000542.mp3,victoria does things in a much bigger way
./data/Client1\sample-000543.mp3,i can't find it anywhere
./data/Client1\sample-000544.mp3,i'd hate to have that many pins stuck in me
./data/Client1\sample-000545.mp3,but what's all this
./data/Client1\sample-000546.mp3,they spoke about mercury salt dragons and kings and he didn't understand any of it
./data/Client1\sample-000547.mp3,they were given to me as a present by a king the boy said
./data/Client1\sample-000548.mp3,they blow across the world without a birthplace and with no place to die
./data/Client1\sample-000549.mp3,he stood irresolute for a moment and then scrambled out of the pit
./data/Client1\sample-000550.mp3,show me where there is life out in the desert
./data/Client1\sample-000551.mp3,and because the tribes declared war i went to the well seeking the alchemist
./data/Client1\sample-000552.mp3,where's the old goat
./data/Client1\sample-000553.mp3,he had seen the shooting star and was persuaded that a meteorite lay somewhere nearby
./data/Client1\sample-000554.mp3,doesnt it defeat the purpose of hashing
./data/Client1\sample-000555.mp3,and that he a boy could perform miracles
./data/Client1\sample-000556.mp3,it won't hurt you and we can make the city edition
./data/Client1\sample-000557.mp3,the navy's going to fly father home this afternoon
./data/Client1\sample-000558.mp3,he's doing it because it's what he wants to do
./data/Client1\sample-000559.mp3,i'm trying to explain to my mother how to get pictures off her phone
./data/Client1\sample-000560.mp3,we ate spicy rice with chicken legs and white mushrooms
./data/Client1\sample-000561.mp3,the heat lasted until nightfall and all that time he had to carry his jacket
./data/Client1\sample-000562.mp3,and i'll sign a paper
./data/Client1\sample-000563.mp3,that's an inherent disadvantage
./data/Client1\sample-000564.mp3,i'd better hustle him up
./data/Client1\sample-000565.mp3,and the sand and gravel had been flung violently in every direction
./data/Client1\sample-000566.mp3,everyone seemed very excited
./data/Client1\sample-000567.mp3,i'm afraid she'd feel ashamed to think she hadn't trusted you
./data/Client1\sample-000568.mp3,but i'm going to egypt the boy said
./data/Client1\sample-000569.mp3,what were you when you came here five years ago
./data/Client1\sample-000570.mp3,i got it back
./data/Client1\sample-000571.mp3,i was disappointed at this inanimate bulk
./data/Client1\sample-000572.mp3,servants came and went with silver trays laden with spices and tea
./data/Client1\sample-000573.mp3,fastfood is convenient but often unhealthy
./data/Client1\sample-000574.mp3,he told her about the morning's meeting
./data/Client1\sample-000575.mp3,about eleven i walked back to my home in maybury because nothing seemed to be happening
./data/Client1\sample-000576.mp3,the nearby city of ceuta had grown faster than tangier and business had fallen off
./data/Client1\sample-000577.mp3,he's deposited ten dollars
./data/Client1\sample-000578.mp3,only us explorers can get it
./data/Client1\sample-000579.mp3,just a memory right now it signified shade water and a refuge from the war
./data/Client1\sample-000580.mp3,there were lights in the upper windows of the houses when the people went to bed
./data/Client1\sample-000581.mp3,didn't i tell you never to come panhandling around here
./data/Client1\sample-000582.mp3,this will help you effectively collaborate with developers and coordinate crossteam projects throughout your career
./data/Client1\sample-000583.mp3,but i didnt think that it contained any living creature
./data/Client1\sample-000584.mp3,but the crystal merchant had no choice
./data/Client1\sample-000585.mp3,it is i the boy answered
./data/Client1\sample-000586.mp3,a thin circle of bright metal showed between the top and the body of the cylinder
./data/Client1\sample-000587.mp3,just handling them made him feel better
./data/Client1\sample-000588.mp3,the man wept with happiness
./data/Client1\sample-000589.mp3,the crowd swayed a little as i elbowed my way through
./data/Client1\sample-000590.mp3,come in again some time
./data/Client1\sample-000591.mp3,raisins are delicious
./data/Client1\sample-000592.mp3,he wanted your money he said
./data/Client1\sample-000593.mp3,i think they perceived that nothing was to be done at the moment
./data/Client1\sample-000594.mp3,maybe she didn't even remember him
./data/Client1\sample-000595.mp3,you mustn't let what she said bother you
./data/Client1\sample-000596.mp3,so what do you want of me the sun asked
./data/Client1\sample-000597.mp3,how much money do you get
./data/Client1\sample-000598.mp3,the shop folks were taking down their shutters and people were opening their bedroom windows
./data/Client1\sample-000599.mp3,how do i guess at the future
./data/Client1\sample-000600.mp3,looking through the telescope i saw a circle of deep blue and the little round planet
./data/Client1\sample-000601.mp3,of course the two were unable to do anything
./data/Client1\sample-000602.mp3,don't mind the colonel
./data/Client1\sample-000603.mp3,he thought of all the married shepherds he had known
./data/Client1\sample-000604.mp3,i need to sell some wool the boy told the merchant
./data/Client1\sample-000605.mp3,and you ought to read more about the world answered the englishman
./data/Client1\sample-000606.mp3,what is a foreigner doing here asked another of the men
./data/Client1\sample-000607.mp3,and then he perceived it very slowly
./data/Client1\sample-000608.mp3,there's that reprieve if they ever find out
./data/Client1\sample-000609.mp3,three days from now he would be with the merchant's daughter
./data/Client1\sample-000610.mp3,if you don't stop following me i'll call the police
./data/Client1\sample-000611.mp3,but maybe people who felt that way had never learned the universal language
./data/Client1\sample-000612.mp3,but the boy never took his eye off his new friend
./data/Client1\sample-000613.mp3,looks like about ten years a piece for you birds
./data/Client1\sample-000614.mp3,henderson went into the railway station to telegraph the news to london
./data/Client1\sample-000615.mp3,the other son was a poet and delighted all of rome with his beautiful verses
./data/Client1\sample-000616.mp3,how about that one there
./data/Client1\sample-000617.mp3,it brought his heart into his mouth
./data/Client1\sample-000618.mp3,one must prepare for it
./data/Client1\sample-000619.mp3,but it is not a class that was requested by our alumni or prospective students
./data/Client1\sample-000620.mp3,they were given to me as a present by a king the boy said
./data/Client1\sample-000621.mp3,it's called the principle of favorability
./data/Client1\sample-000622.mp3,a man doesn't get in a situation like this every day
./data/Client1\sample-000623.mp3,can i get a woot woot
./data/Client1\sample-000624.mp3,i think it's about bird hunting but now i can see how that might be misinterpreted
./data/Client1\sample-000625.mp3,it looked like a rusty gas float
./data/Client1\sample-000626.mp3,sunburns can be avoided by applying sunscreen or by staying in the shadows
./data/Client1\sample-000627.mp3,if you pay attention to the present you can improve upon it
./data/Client1\sample-000628.mp3,if he ever decided to leave them they would suffer
./data/Client1\sample-000629.mp3,take charge of him
./data/Client1\sample-000630.mp3,i lost my wallet
./data/Client1\sample-000631.mp3,all they wanted was food and water
./data/Client1\sample-000632.mp3,he's nuts about you
./data/Client1\sample-000633.mp3,and we'll be at larissa's bar up the street
./data/Client1\sample-000634.mp3,i don't know why these things have to be transmitted by word of mouth he thought
./data/Client1\sample-000635.mp3,it's the other foreigner the englishman
./data/Client1\sample-000636.mp3,and a labor leader like melville
./data/Client1\sample-000637.mp3,they might even have become friends but the englishman closed off the conversation
./data/Client1\sample-000638.mp3,you'll never get it out of me
./data/Client1\sample-000639.mp3,it was the pure language of the world
./data/Client1\sample-000640.mp3,as soon as he saw me among the crowd he called to me to come down
./data/Client1\sample-000641.mp3,i can't please everybody
./data/Client1\sample-000642.mp3,i don't want to change anything because i don't know how to deal with change
./data/Client1\sample-000643.mp3,if you pay attention to the present you can improve upon it
./data/Client1\sample-000644.mp3,they went to the kitchen at the back of the monastery
./data/Client1\sample-000645.mp3,'m all about those invisible cosmic connections that transcend time and distance
./data/Client1\sample-000646.mp3,if what one finds is made of pure matter it will never spoil
./data/Client1\sample-000647.mp3,will i learn to do that someday the boy asked
./data/Client1\sample-000648.mp3,the people will enjoy the tea and want to buy the glasses
./data/Client1\sample-000649.mp3,hunches his mother used to call them
./data/Client1\sample-000650.mp3,by the light of their own destruction i saw them staggering and falling and their supporters turning to run
./data/Client1\sample-000651.mp3,as he did so he talked with the monk about the tribal wars
./data/Client1\sample-000652.mp3,it had told him to dig where his tears fell
./data/Client1\sample-000653.mp3,he did find it soon after dawn and not far from the sand pits
./data/Client1\sample-000654.mp3,mohammed is a wonderful guitar player
./data/Client1\sample-000655.mp3,i'm trying to explain to my mother how to get pictures off her phone
./data/Client1\sample-000656.mp3,i'm trying to explain to my mother how to get pictures off her phone
./data/Client1\sample-000657.mp3,a large piece suddenly came off and fell with a loud and sharp noise
./data/Client1\sample-000658.mp3,does a man's heart always help him the boy asked the alchemist
./data/Client1\sample-000659.mp3,love is the falcon's flight over your sands
./data/Client1\sample-000660.mp3,the top had certainly ceased to rotate
./data/Client1\sample-000661.mp3,and he knew what was the fair price for every one of his animals
./data/Client1\sample-000662.mp3,many telescopes were pointed at it
./data/Client1\sample-000663.mp3,many telescopes were pointed at it
./data/Client1\sample-000664.mp3,they're calling to us not to give up and to keep on fighting
./data/Client1\sample-000665.mp3,it was a bundle of money
./data/Client1\sample-000666.mp3,i just don't trust anyone who says they've never had hamburger helper
./data/Client1\sample-000667.mp3,ogilvy told him everything that he had seen
./data/Client1\sample-000668.mp3,he heard a muffled grating sound and saw the black mark jerk forward an inch or so
./data/Client1\sample-000669.mp3,i'm going to them
./data/Client1\sample-000670.mp3,i had the everyone has gary busey's teeth dream again
./data/Client1\sample-000671.mp3,sunburns can be avoided by applying sunscreen or by staying in the shadows
./data/Client1\sample-000672.mp3,that's why i'm here
./data/Client1\sample-000673.mp3,and the last one
./data/Client1\sample-000674.mp3,a lot of money
./data/Client1\sample-000675.mp3,absolutely despicable that gingerbread men are forced to live in houses made of their own flesh
./data/Client1\sample-000676.mp3,sometime during the second year you'll remember about the treasure
./data/Client1\sample-000677.mp3,i said i wish i'd never been born
./data/Client1\sample-000678.mp3,they spoke about mercury salt dragons and kings and he didn't understand any of it
./data/Client1\sample-000679.mp3,i thought the unscrewing might be automatic
./data/Client1\sample-000680.mp3,are you going to believe every lie he tells you
./data/Client1\sample-000681.mp3,there was a hole there among the stones
./data/Client1\sample-000682.mp3,licorice is a black chewy food
./data/Client1\sample-000683.mp3,i'm not hiding anything the boy answered
./data/Client1\sample-000684.mp3,the sheep fidgeted nearby uneasy with their new owner and excited by so much change
./data/Client1\sample-000685.mp3,that day the merchant gave the boy permission to build the display
./data/Client1\sample-000686.mp3,henderson was taking it in
./data/Client1\sample-000687.mp3,i myself heard nothing of that
./data/Client1\sample-000688.mp3,there were mountains in the distance
./data/Client1\sample-000689.mp3,i didn't come here to have you read my palm he said already regretting having come
./data/Client1\sample-000690.mp3,i have to admit that my horizon has expanded exponentially
./data/Client1\sample-000691.mp3,it sort of makes a fellow lose faith in himself
./data/Client1\sample-000692.mp3,those gypsies are really smart he thought
./data/Client1\sample-000693.mp3,do i look as funny as you do
./data/Client1\sample-000694.mp3,but i'm liable to get into a jam
./data/Client1\sample-000695.mp3,all the villagers cheered
./data/Client1\sample-000696.mp3,they blow across the world without a birthplace and with no place to die
./data/Client1\sample-000697.mp3,the old man was probably a gypsy too
./data/Client1\sample-000698.mp3,this morning i found a calculator taped to my wii
./data/Client1\sample-000699.mp3,you brought a new feeling into my crystal shop
./data/Client1\sample-000700.mp3,the streamer of gas came out towards us
./data/Client1\sample-000701.mp3,my mind ran on the possibilities of its content
./data/Client1\sample-000702.mp3,because he was terrified the boy didn't answer
./data/Client1\sample-000703.mp3,because the crystal was dirty
./data/Client1\sample-000704.mp3,they're only made of rock crystal and there are millions of rock crystals in the earth
./data/Client1\sample-000705.mp3,they looked for the fallen mass but found nothing
./data/Client1\sample-000706.mp3,in some places the ground was covered with the salt of driedup lakes
./data/Client1\sample-000707.mp3,what good is money to you if you're going to die
./data/Client1\sample-000708.mp3,the day was dawning and the shepherd urged his sheep in the direction of the sun
./data/Client1\sample-000709.mp3,sort of a jack london style
./data/Client1\sample-000710.mp3,that sobered him a little
./data/Client1\sample-000711.mp3,then the thing came upon him in a flash
./data/Client1\sample-000712.mp3,he just got a new kite for his birthday
./data/Client1\sample-000713.mp3,but he granted the travelers three days
./data/Client1\sample-000714.mp3,well then help me do that the boy said
./data/Client1\sample-000715.mp3,i am here the boy said
./data/Client1\sample-000716.mp3,the arrow was pointing to the exit
./data/Client1\sample-000717.mp3,i'm going to guide you across the desert the alchemist said
./data/Client1\sample-000718.mp3,do you see this
./data/Client1\sample-000719.mp3,they were tribesmen dressed in blue with black rings surrounding their turbans
./data/Client1\sample-000720.mp3,the library is open to everyone
./data/Client1\sample-000721.mp3,that's comparing apples and oranges
./data/Client1\sample-000722.mp3,it was a tent like many at the oasis
./data/Client1\sample-000723.mp3,he decided to concentrate on more practical matters
./data/Client1\sample-000724.mp3,she wrote the stuff
./data/Client1\sample-000725.mp3,it was such a gradual movement that he found it only by noticing the dots
./data/Client1\sample-000726.mp3,the hookahs were extinguished and the guards stood at attention
./data/Client1\sample-000727.mp3,another who was searching the boy's bags found the piece of gold
./data/Client1\sample-000728.mp3,ogilvy watched till one and then gave up
./data/Client1\sample-000729.mp3,i never saw amanda act like that before
./data/Client1\sample-000730.mp3,the alchemist removed the pan from the fire and set it aside to cool
./data/Client1\sample-000731.mp3,of course you wouldn't know
./data/Client1\sample-000732.mp3,for every ten dead men among our enemies you will receive a piece of gold
./data/Client1\sample-000733.mp3,and because the tribes declared war i went to the well seeking the alchemist
./data/Client1\sample-000734.mp3,because now he knew where his treasure was
./data/Client1\sample-000735.mp3,do you have any secret hiding place here in the house
./data/Client1\sample-000736.mp3,you don't have to sign anything
./data/Client1\sample-000737.mp3,i'm going to need it
./data/Client1\sample-000738.mp3,i have the money i need to buy my sheep
./data/Client1\sample-000739.mp3,i bet you forgot the wine
./data/Client1\sample-000740.mp3,not even the tribal chieftains are able to see him when they want to
./data/Client1\sample-000741.mp3,but that was simply because my eye was tired
./data/Client1\sample-000742.mp3,the boy didn't know what to say
./data/Client1\sample-000743.mp3,as he was leaving he saw in the corner of the room his old shepherd's pouch
./data/Client1\sample-000744.mp3,is there a mrs joshua
./data/Client1\sample-000745.mp3,i want you to help me turn myself into the wind the boy answered
./data/Client1\sample-000746.mp3,you knew the whole story
./data/Client1\sample-000747.mp3,maybe we'd better ask someone the boy suggested
./data/Client1\sample-000748.mp3,he heard a muffled grating sound and saw the black mark jerk forward an inch or so
./data/Client1\sample-000749.mp3,the monk laughed when he saw me come back in tatters
./data/Client1\sample-000750.mp3,you dominated those horsemen with the way you looked at them he said
./data/Client1\sample-000751.mp3,you wanna take this outside
./data/Client1\sample-000752.mp3,the girl dropped the container and the water spilled
./data/Client1\sample-000753.mp3,what tricks would i pull
./data/Client1\sample-000754.mp3,this solution also works well if you want to install a linux distro on windows via virtualization
./data/Client1\sample-000755.mp3,because for him you are a green field from which he always returns with game
./data/Client1\sample-000756.mp3,drawing from my own experience as a learner of english and german i value engaging activities that involve everyday conversation
./data/Client1\sample-000757.mp3,it was only when i got this close to it that the strangeness of it was at all evident to me
./data/Client1\sample-000758.mp3,but the boy couldn't even speak
./data/Client1\sample-000759.mp3,february took a book from the shelves
./data/Client1\sample-000760.mp3,i need you to be spontaneous he asked me out to din din
./data/Client1\sample-000761.mp3,it was faintly marked with transverse stripes and slightly flattened from the perfect round
./data/Client1\sample-000762.mp3,the caravans had been stopped at giza for some time waiting for the wars to end
./data/Client1\sample-000763.mp3,until then he had considered the omens to be things of this world
./data/Client1\sample-000764.mp3,absolutely despicable that gingerbread men are forced to live in houses made of their own flesh
./data/Client1\sample-000765.mp3,that's what makes it romantic
./data/Client1\sample-000766.mp3,the football jocks laughed viciously
./data/Client1\sample-000767.mp3,you're worth your weight in gold
./data/Client1\sample-000768.mp3,the elevators are still running
./data/Client1\sample-000769.mp3,but use them to buy your flock
./data/Client1\sample-000770.mp3,the serpent relaxed immediately
./data/Client1\sample-000771.mp3,i think they perceived that nothing was to be done at the moment
./data/Client1\sample-000772.mp3,because i've always heard about them the boy answered saying nothing about his dream
./data/Client1\sample-000773.mp3,that sobered him a little
./data/Client1\sample-000774.mp3,the two men hurried back and found the cylinder still lying in the same position
./data/Client1\sample-000775.mp3,have you got a mirror
./data/Client1\sample-000776.mp3,the tribal chieftains will appreciate what you do
./data/Client1\sample-000777.mp3,the guy thought he was a lunatic at large and made an unsuccessful attempt to stop him
./data/Client1\sample-000778.mp3,air was either entering or escaping at the rim with a thin sizzling sound
./data/Client1\sample-000779.mp3,the pilots braced themselves for impact
./data/Client1\sample-000780.mp3,it was a a kind of fascination that paralysed my actions
./data/Client1\sample-000781.mp3,looking down at the spoon he held the boy saw that the oil was gone
./data/Client1\sample-000782.mp3,having heard that the boy became even more interested in alchemy
./data/Client1\sample-000783.mp3,at the first glance it was really not very exciting
./data/Client1\sample-000784.mp3,and we'll be at larissa's bar up the street
./data/Client1\sample-000785.mp3,he needed someone to talk to so as to avoid thinking about the possibility of war
./data/Client1\sample-000786.mp3,it's the oasis said the camel driver
./data/Client1\sample-000787.mp3,i went stretching my legs clumsily and feeling my way in the dark
./data/Client1\sample-000788.mp3,i can explain if you'll just listen
./data/Client1\sample-000789.mp3,they're not my sheep anymore he said to himself without nostalgia
./data/Client1\sample-000790.mp3,it's not a lie
./data/Client1\sample-000791.mp3,it was starlight and i explained the signs of the zodiac to her
./data/Client1\sample-000792.mp3,had our instruments permitted it we might have been able to see the trouble way back when
./data/Client1\sample-000793.mp3,strange images passed through my mind
./data/Client1\sample-000794.mp3,no one paid any attention to the two travelers
./data/Client1\sample-000795.mp3,he asked it please never to stop speaking to him
./data/Client1\sample-000796.mp3,well then why do we need all these books the boy asked
./data/Client1\sample-000797.mp3,just as a rule of thumb
./data/Client1\sample-000798.mp3,i really did it quite brilliantly
./data/Client1\sample-000799.mp3,and look how many things the wind already knew how to do
./data/Client1\sample-000800.mp3,get me walter burns
./data/Client1\sample-000801.mp3,he was proud of himself
./data/Client1\sample-000802.mp3,people continued to come and go from the baker's shop
./data/Client1\sample-000803.mp3,the thing itself was almost entirely buried in sand
./data/Client1\sample-000804.mp3,you point to a trail of ants leading into the house
./data/Client1\sample-000805.mp3,when i'm eating that's all i think about
./data/Client1\sample-000806.mp3,for at that time it had not occurred to him that it might be hollow
./data/Client1\sample-000807.mp3,i wish you'd forget about us
./data/Client1\sample-000808.mp3,the night was warm and i was thirsty
./data/Client1\sample-000809.mp3,the book that most interested the boy told the stories of the famous alchemists
./data/Client1\sample-000810.mp3,are you crazy the boy asked the alchemist when they had moved on
./data/Client1\sample-000811.mp3,that's why i keep losing
./data/Client1\sample-000812.mp3,my allergy has gotten much worse today
./data/Client1\sample-000813.mp3,i'm talking about the building and loan
./data/Client1\sample-000814.mp3,been seeing me in your dreams
./data/Client1\sample-000815.mp3,the stranger withdrew the sword from the boy's forehead and the boy felt immensely relieved
./data/Client1\sample-000816.mp3,she never grew up
./data/Client1\sample-000817.mp3,the boy was relieved
./data/Client1\sample-000818.mp3,from the railway station in the distance came the sound of trains ringing and rumbling
./data/Client1\sample-000819.mp3,my tax dollars pay for those public school proms
./data/Client1\sample-000820.mp3,same way you did
./data/Client1\sample-000821.mp3,the boy stood up shakily and looked once more at the pyramids
./data/Client1\sample-000822.mp3,what is love the desert asked
./data/Client1\sample-000823.mp3,among these people were a couple of cyclists a gardener i employed sometimes and a girl carrying a baby
./data/Client1\sample-000824.mp3,i want those stamps
./data/Client1\sample-000825.mp3,i've always wanted to do this
./data/Client1\sample-000826.mp3,we have also started contemplating the possibility of moving back to colorado
./data/Client1\sample-000827.mp3,that man is terrific
./data/Client1\sample-000828.mp3,most meteorites are more or less rounded
./data/Client1\sample-000829.mp3,but the alchemist continued to look to the horizon
./data/Client1\sample-000830.mp3,you will never reopen
./data/Client1\sample-000831.mp3,you dont compare directly to existing stateoftheart methods
./data/Client1\sample-000832.mp3,but he certainly didn't desire that an army invade the oasis
./data/Client1\sample-000833.mp3,i'm smoking too much
./data/Client1\sample-000834.mp3,it left a greenish streak that glowed for some seconds
./data/Client1\sample-000835.mp3,and he told what he had seen
./data/Client1\sample-000836.mp3,the tea seemed less bitter
./data/Client1\sample-000837.mp3,had our instruments permitted it we might have been able to see the trouble way back when
./data/Client1\sample-000838.mp3,not to worry said the alchemist
./data/Client1\sample-000839.mp3,earlier this year we found a really nice place near my office and we moved in together
./data/Client1\sample-000840.mp3,but that was simply because my eye was tired
./data/Client1\sample-000841.mp3,the boy mumbled an answer that allowed him to avoid responding to her question
./data/Client1\sample-000842.mp3,who is your friend the chief asked
./data/Client1\sample-000843.mp3,two days ago you said that i had never dreamed of travel the merchant answered
./data/Client1\sample-000844.mp3,'m all about those invisible cosmic connections that transcend time and distance
./data/Client1\sample-000845.mp3,he paused for a moment to see if the woman knew what the egyptian pyramids were
./data/Client1\sample-000846.mp3,mecca is a lot farther away than the pyramids
./data/Client1\sample-000847.mp3,that night he told all of this to the alchemist
./data/Client1\sample-000848.mp3,the heather was on fire and you could see a thin blue smoke rising up slowly
./data/Client1\sample-000849.mp3,from there he could see africa in the distance
./data/Client1\sample-000850.mp3,had our instruments permitted it we might have been able to see the trouble way back when
./data/Client1\sample-000851.mp3,the alchemist erased the circle in the sand and the snake slithered away among the rocks
./data/Client1\sample-000852.mp3,i need you to be spontaneous he asked me out to din din
./data/Client1\sample-000853.mp3,i'm afraid the joke's on us
./data/Client1\sample-000854.mp3,revenge is not my style but obviously accidents will happen
./data/Client1\sample-000855.mp3,the boy put the stones in his pouch
./data/Client1\sample-000856.mp3,the birthday party was a surprise
./data/Client1\sample-000857.mp3,the wind began to blow again
./data/Client1\sample-000858.mp3,you can't go any farther one of them said
./data/Client1\sample-000859.mp3,and what a way to quit
./data/Client1\sample-000860.mp3,the heather was on fire and you could see a thin blue smoke rising up slowly
./data/Client1\sample-000861.mp3,i'm the king of salem the old man had said
./data/Client1\sample-000862.mp3,and stop threatening that boy
./data/Client1\sample-000863.mp3,then he turned to the boy
./data/Client1\sample-000864.mp3,for users it is important that they can trust their operating system
./data/Client1\sample-000865.mp3,well why don't you go to mecca now asked the boy
./data/Client1\sample-000866.mp3,the monk was irritated
./data/Client1\sample-000867.mp3,and the sand and gravel had been flung violently in every direction
./data/Client1\sample-000868.mp3,we don't know when the war will end so we can't continue our journey he said
./data/Client1\sample-000869.mp3,can't you read me
./data/Client1\sample-000870.mp3,all things are one the boy thought
./data/Client1\sample-000871.mp3,don't tell me what to do
./data/Client1\sample-000872.mp3,the problem is that they don't even realize that they're walking a new road every day
./data/Client1\sample-000873.mp3,that's what i'm going to do
./data/Client1\sample-000874.mp3,he was older and was carrying a small bucket
./data/Client1\sample-000875.mp3,will you give me those stamps
./data/Client1\sample-000876.mp3,i left her hanging around the american express
./data/Client1\sample-000877.mp3,he had been to the village only once the year before
./data/Client1\sample-000878.mp3,none of what the old man was saying made much sense to the boy
./data/Client1\sample-000879.mp3,one day the earth began to tremble and the nile overflowed its banks
./data/Client1\sample-000880.mp3,whatever the thing observed one could find a connection with his experience of the moment
./data/Client1\sample-000881.mp3,he had tried in vain to establish a relationship with an alchemist
./data/Client1\sample-000882.mp3,look at those shoulders
./data/Client1\sample-000883.mp3,the sun thought for a minute
./data/Client1\sample-000884.mp3,so he could not be hasty nor impatient
./data/Client1\sample-000885.mp3,he just got a new kite for his birthday
./data/Client1\sample-000886.mp3,i will be back soon
./data/Client1\sample-000887.mp3,we're refugees from the tribal wars and we need money the other figure said
./data/Client1\sample-000888.mp3,mrs sarah doesn't either
./data/Client1\sample-000889.mp3,welli don't quite know what to say
./data/Client1\sample-000890.mp3,he was excited and at the same time uneasy maybe the girl had already forgotten him
./data/Client1\sample-000891.mp3,i thought you were chasing me
./data/Client1\sample-000892.mp3,that he wanted to travel
./data/Client1\sample-000893.mp3,note that it does have builtin support for web browsing although i find it doesn't work very well
./data/Client1\sample-000894.mp3,the burning fire had been extinguished
./data/Client1\sample-000895.mp3,there are four different sorts of fuel at this gas station
./data/Client1\sample-000896.mp3,i gotta figure some way out of this thing
./data/Client1\sample-000897.mp3,it drew a droplet of blood
./data/Client1\sample-000898.mp3,this behavior of neural networks is sometimes called dreaming
./data/Client1\sample-000899.mp3,don't you know there's a war on
./data/Client1\sample-000900.mp3,then the thing came upon him in a flash
./data/Client1\sample-000901.mp3,the men fell into an animated discussion
./data/Client1\sample-000902.mp3,the boy was shaking with fear but the alchemist helped him out of the tent
./data/Client1\sample-000903.mp3,the crowd swayed a little as i elbowed my way through
./data/Client1\sample-000904.mp3,all the joy he had seen that morning had suddenly disappeared
./data/Client1\sample-000905.mp3,i haven't been able to shake him since
./data/Client1\sample-000906.mp3,i'm afraid i might have soiled the couch a little with my shoes eddie murphy
./data/Client1\sample-000907.mp3,i went stretching my legs clumsily and feeling my way in the dark
./data/Client1\sample-000908.mp3,the jacket had a purpose and so did the boy
./data/Client1\sample-000909.mp3,who told you that asked the boy startled
./data/Client1\sample-000910.mp3,he decided to spend the night there
./data/Client1\sample-000911.mp3,my father offered her a job
./data/Client1\sample-000912.mp3,it was papa that sends you flowers every day
./data/Client1\sample-000913.mp3,another dreamer said the ticket seller to his assistant watching the boy walk away
./data/Client1\sample-000914.mp3,everyone seemed very excited
./data/Client1\sample-000915.mp3,i jumped in to save rachel
./data/Client1\sample-000916.mp3,that's the man who knows all the secrets of the world she said
./data/Client1\sample-000917.mp3,is the head better
./data/Client1\sample-000918.mp3,he remembered the sword
./data/Client1\sample-000919.mp3,that woman is gonna be on that roof
./data/Client1\sample-000920.mp3,i wished i had a light to smoke by
./data/Client1\sample-000921.mp3,it was such a gradual movement that he found it only by noticing the dots
./data/Client1\sample-000922.mp3,he recited an our father silently
./data/Client1\sample-000923.mp3,there were really i think two or three hundred people elbowing one another
./data/Client1\sample-000924.mp3,and here's a kiss for you
./data/Client1\sample-000925.mp3,who wrote that speech for you
./data/Client1\sample-000926.mp3,save that for the tribune
./data/Client1\sample-000927.mp3,they set off running wildly into the trees
./data/Client1\sample-000928.mp3,some went away while i was there and other people came
./data/Client1\sample-000929.mp3,i don't like seals anyhow
./data/Client1\sample-000930.mp3,they spoke about mercury salt dragons and kings and he didn't understand any of it
./data/Client1\sample-000931.mp3,and the leader posted armed sentinels at the fringes of the group
./data/Client1\sample-000932.mp3,there are so many things to learn
./data/Client1\sample-000933.mp3,yet it was a little too large for assurance
./data/Client1\sample-000934.mp3,that night there was another jetting out of gas from the distant planet
./data/Client1\sample-000935.mp3,the ship appeared to be constructed with some form of chromium exoskeleton
./data/Client1\sample-000936.mp3,nobody knows how much ammunition the military has in its checkpoints
./data/Client1\sample-000937.mp3,it's the philosophy that guarantees everyone's freedom
./data/Client1\sample-000938.mp3,they looked for the fallen mass but found nothing
./data/Client1\sample-000939.mp3,a line of flame high can be seen in the atmosphere
./data/Client1\sample-000940.mp3,maybe this is an omen said the englishman half aloud
./data/Client1\sample-000941.mp3,you're the one who may die the alchemist said
./data/Client1\sample-000942.mp3,there was hardly any movement from the pit
./data/Client1\sample-000943.mp3,then a man approached
./data/Client1\sample-000944.mp3,besides that there was a heap of bicycles
./data/Client1\sample-000945.mp3,and don't forget the language of omens
./data/Client1\sample-000946.mp3,maybe that's why they always stay close to me
./data/Client1\sample-000947.mp3,i'm an alchemist simply because i'm an alchemist he said as he prepared the meal
./data/Client1\sample-000948.mp3,jennifer's expression changed pull my finger she said
./data/Client1\sample-000949.mp3,they were both silent for a time observing the plaza and the townspeople
./data/Client1\sample-000950.mp3,the old man leafed through the book and fell to reading a page he came to
./data/Client1\sample-000951.mp3,i pointed out mars a bright dot of light
./data/Client1\sample-000952.mp3,and he wasn't faring much better
./data/Client1\sample-000953.mp3,the people will enjoy the tea and want to buy the glasses
./data/Client1\sample-000954.mp3,relaxed and unhurried he resolved that he would walk through the narrow streets of tangier
./data/Client1\sample-000955.mp3,the meeting was over
./data/Client1\sample-000956.mp3,all i saw was an army said the boy
./data/Client1\sample-000957.mp3,that wasn't at all necessary
./data/Client1\sample-000958.mp3,i was scared but wasted no time in going out and crossing the bridge to the sand pits
./data/Client1\sample-000959.mp3,when he emerged it was with a young arab dressed in white and gold
./data/Client1\sample-000960.mp3,were they quick or were they enraged
./data/Client1\sample-000961.mp3,the tribal chieftains will appreciate what you do
./data/Client1\sample-000962.mp3,at least she knows how to behave at funerals
./data/Client1\sample-000963.mp3,but there was something there in his heart that wouldn't allow him to do so
./data/Client1\sample-000964.mp3,the boy saw a man appear behind the counter
./data/Client1\sample-000965.mp3,but everything that happens twice will surely happen a third time
./data/Client1\sample-000966.mp3,'and this is what your son said' the angel told the man
./data/Client1\sample-000967.mp3,but that was simply because my eye was tired
./data/Client1\sample-000968.mp3,want to know what it is
./data/Client1\sample-000969.mp3,if good things are coming they will be a pleasant surprise said the seer
./data/Client1\sample-000970.mp3,how are you doing today
./data/Client1\sample-000971.mp3,you should see the other guy specifically how good at fighting he is
./data/Client1\sample-000972.mp3,if it would save a woman's life
./data/Client1\sample-000973.mp3,he didn't want any conversation at this point
./data/Client1\sample-000974.mp3,they were all furious when the escapade failed
./data/Client1\sample-000975.mp3,it always helps to be learning something new and exciting
./data/Client1\sample-000976.mp3,where are you bound asked the young arab
./data/Client1\sample-000977.mp3,at that time it was quite clear in my own mind that the thing had come from the planet mars
./data/Client1\sample-000978.mp3,i'm getting out of here and you can't stop me
./data/Client1\sample-000979.mp3,i'm not afraid of failing
./data/Client1\sample-000980.mp3,something happens here you'll have to remember later on
./data/Client1\sample-000981.mp3,he sat on a stone and allowed himself to become hypnotized by the horizon
./data/Client1\sample-000982.mp3,any dope yet on how he got out
./data/Client1\sample-000983.mp3,they're not for sale he said
./data/Client1\sample-000984.mp3,the invaders carried the name everywhere the beautiful girl spoke of the invaders with pride
./data/Client1\sample-000985.mp3,mind if i sit down
./data/Client1\sample-000986.mp3,the boy continued to listen to his heart as they crossed the desert
./data/Client1\sample-000987.mp3,he had studied latin spanish and theology
./data/Client1\sample-000988.mp3,mr bean is the main character of a british comedy
./data/Client1\sample-000989.mp3,the ideas should be presented in a more concise and direct manner
./data/Client1\sample-000990.mp3,absolutely despicable that gingerbread men are forced to live in houses made of their own flesh
./data/Client1\sample-000991.mp3,i'm going to check up on that right away
./data/Client1\sample-000992.mp3,butmaybe i'll never have another chance to get to the pyramids in egypt
./data/Client1\sample-000993.mp3,i heard a peculiar humming sound from the pit
./data/Client1\sample-000994.mp3,except for the dream
./data/Client1\sample-000995.mp3,it was engineering at its finest
./data/Client1\sample-000996.mp3,all things are one
./data/Client1\sample-000997.mp3,of course the two were unable to do anything
./data/Client1\sample-000998.mp3,i need you to be spontaneous he asked me out to din din
./data/Client1\sample-000999.mp3,how about once more around the park
